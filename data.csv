Validation for everyone who needs it,"You doubt your feelings regarding a certain event because when it happend you remembered it as maybe it wasn’t that traumatic, maybe it didn’t affect you so much, you feel like you handled it just fine but then in the present you suddenly get overwhelmed with pain, grief and fear and you try to stuff it down because no iT wAsN‘t ThAt BaD and you keep convincing yourself you’re overreacting because you keep thinking it wasn’t that bad and it didn’t even matter.

I Need Help,"... But I don't know how or from who. I don't know what to do at this point.  I'm scared that I'm never going to be ok.

What do you find frustrating about therapy?, I was reading some statistics on PTSD and found that 43% of patients dropout of therapy for their condition. I was wondering why you  think this is the case and what your experience has been like with treatment?
I’m damaged,"Ptsd is like staying/feeling stuck in that moment that made you this way on a endless loop over and over again no matter what you do it’s like you can’t overcome it
You can’t do anything about it no amount of closure will do anything I have to live with the fact I am damaged beyond repair I miss the days I could relax or feel balanced with myself/others but now nighttime is the worst it’s like the pushing back of the memory/pain I suppress during the day is unleashed where I can cry for hours which doesn’t do anything because no amount of tears will fix me Are there even success stories where someone was able to heal this condition"
What to do when you don't have access to therapy/medication?,"Everybody says do yoga, take walks, eat healthy, get enough sleep, talk to people. What to do when you've done all that and the trauma is still winning? I've tried meditation, I've tried aromatherapy, I've tried self help books. Everyday I am paralyzed by fear and have no idea what to do next.

I can't get therapy or medication now and maybe not for years. The why is a long story, just trust me it can't be done right now."
I don't know how to talk to a therapist about this shit.,"So recently I realized I blocked out a lot of my early childhood, I'm 14F and my first traumatic memory is from when I was 6, I was molested and about 2 years ago I realized what my grandpa had done to me for years was assault and I started remembering when he did it, I always was uncomfortable with what he was doing but thinking of an adult doing such a horrible thing to a child was terrifying. It had happened before but only by kids around my age, an adult doing that was even worse to me. It continued until recently, and after my grandpa stopped it still happened by other people. I have nightmares about it, and I'll have panic attacks when I think about it, it plays through my head on repeat. I'll hear certain phrases and I'll spiral, and I still have to be around him but when that happens I close myself off emotionally and try not to stay around him for too long. I suspect I have some kind of it, probably mildly but I don't know how to talk to my therapist about it. I trust her but it's hard to talk about and I don't want her to call cps or something.



Any advice on how to talk about it without completely breaking down?

TW,"I’m really triggered by people praising Kobe Bryant all day today. So many people I know personally have talked about how he inspired them and how great of a person he was, and it makes me want to throw up. I don’t know what to do. I haven’t felt this bad in a while."
i thought i was improving,"i dont really know how to do this. i haven't done anything like this before. i'll just jump into it. i started dating someone back in 2017 when i was 17. i was blinded by the fact that someone liked me back for the first time and ignored all the red flags. he began manipulating me from the start but i didnt notice. soon he became mentally and verbally abusive. i was never comfortable having sex with him but i knew it was what he wanted so i went along with it. in the beginning it was exciting because i was a virgin but it started to feel like something i had to do, like chore. he also made me feel like i had to perform oral sex on him multiple times every time we hung out. after being together for about 8 months he raped me for the first time. this was the first time i said no. he wanted to do something i didnt and he forced me to. i kept saying no but he thought it was funny. that happened multiple times. around 10 months into dating he dumped me over text. a couple weeks later i found out he was cheating on me when we were together. finding that out after all the abuse he put me through sent me to rock bottom. i was furious at him. i was furious at myself for allowing this all to happen. i was so upset. while we were together he manipulated me to the point where i felt i couldnt live without him. so when i found that out, i tried to take my own life. this was july of 2018.

Permanent change?,"Well I just got diagnosed last week after months of no improvement following an accident. What worries me the most is the way it changes your brain.

"To anyone that wants to help, this post will be extremely long but just hang in there. I have a sense of humor and a fucked story. Hear me out please and thank you","Hi, I am a 22f married to a 21m, going on three years together and two babies. Moved from the small town we grew up in, across the country, thousands of miles away from everything, and we have loved it. 3 days after being home from a c section with our second baby, I caught my husband on Omegle and masturbating. But not the video chat Omegle, just the chat rooms. So I was pretty confused right? About a week before I went into labor, I told him that I understand I’m not going to be able to have sex for a while, so it’s okay if he watches porn here and there until I’m healed. We have had significant problems in our marriage with him going behind my back with porn, so that’s why I clarified with him that it was okay during this time. We both agreed he would only get on pornhub, no chat rooms, no live cams, nothing involving real interaction with people, and he of course agreed. So back to the day I caught him on Omegle. He was so mean to me when I was like “what the fuck I thought we agreed on JUST porn??!” And started screaming that I’m judging him for the type of things he likes to get him off, how it’s just what he likes and I shouldn’t be throwing such a fit. Meanwhile I’m sitting there like ??????? Because 1, my husband has never been mean to me especially during an argument. He’s always handled it well. Sure, we get heated but never anything nasty. That day he was nasty to me. And 2, UH we both agreed you wouldn’t be on that shit, so, why you on that shit!! 
Okay... so then it takes days of investigation and asking every question under the sun about this situation and he was being shady so, I told him i was going to download the data to his social media. That’s when he cracked and admitted to getting on Omegle and finding women to sext with on Snapchat. He would wake up for work, kiss me and our children goodbye, get on Omegle as soon as he leaves the driveway, and *literally* jerked off while driving AND snapchatting?!? Alllll the way to work, then while he was at work, he does a lot of driving around so he has time to be on his phone. So you can guess he was doing that all day too. Not jerking off tho, just getting pictures from women and talking to them all day, then he’d find someone to sext on the same 20 minute drive back home, delete all evidence (cus he knows I’ll go through that shit) and walks in the door like nothing ever happened. GUYS HE DID THIS FOR THE ENTIRE THREE YEARS WE’VE SHARED A LIFE TOGETHER. now, just a little fyi. I am fucking awesome. I’m a great lover. Not to suck my own tit or anything but I’ve done nothing wrong to this man. Just endless amounts of love pouring from me every second for him. Sex is amazing too so it’s not that. He at that point, tells me that he’s had a heavy porn addiction for a really long time, even before he met me. He would go as far as jerking off in a porta potty at work in the middle of a construction zone. Scary shit. Shit that I did NOT have any idea that was happening the entire time. It gets worse. 
He got fired from his previous job a while back, because his boss accused him of stealing. Of course my husband denied this to the fullest of his abilities. Fast forward to the present, it’s been a couple weeks now that he’s told me about the Snapchat and porn addiction thing. It’s Christmas fucking eve. We’re whiskey drunk, he gets some liquid courage and says “you wanna know the real me? Here it goes!” And tells me that he did in fact, steal his bosses credit card information several times to use on chaturbate and he would park at a certain spot every day after work, text or call me saying he had some work to do at the “shop” and he’d be home soon, but really he was paying women to do things for him on camera, with stolen money. At that time in our lives, we were also barely able to pay our bills, we had a toddler and I was about 6 months pregnant. I don’t approve of stealing especially from an individual, but if he was going to do something that fucking stupid I was hoping it would at least be something to help our family. Not put our family at an even greater risk. After hearing that I was like oh woah okay so that’s fucked and I definitely don’t trust you, I don’t even really know who you are right now??? Understandably. This is not the man I married at all. But I tell him we will work through this, I will work with him and his addiction and anything that comes with it, I’m ready to take it on with him, as long as he knows he’s ready to quit the shit and start new. So of course he’s all ecstatic that I’m staying and that lasts for a good couple of days and then the tension started setting in. I was triggered by everything, couldn’t even be in our car without feeling like I’m crawling out of my skin because all I can picture is the things my husband did in this car. The things he’s said to other women that I have probably never heard. Like, traumatized. I was scared of everything at that point. Of course I was scared that he didn’t really love me like he should, I wasn’t enough for him, all of that jazz that comes along with someone ripping your heart out of your fucking chest. But I still tried to keep a smile on my face and be strong to help him through all of this, every day. A month passes and we’ve started getting into nasty arguments about how I can’t let go of the past? (It has literally been a month, and it was some traumatic shit to learn) and how I’m just too sad and he’ll never be able to make me happy. 
His favorite thing to do right now is shut down, give up and call divorce on every. Single. Fight. We. Have. One argument, he was at work and he was saying how he’s done with this and blah. I leave the house for a little and come home later that evening when he’s already back home. I found out he had gotten on a sugar dating site called seeking, PUT THAT HE WAS A SUGAR DADDY AND MADE 150,000 A YEAR. his bio said “recently divorced, looking for drinks, hookups, anything really. Ask about me” The fucking audacity. He does not make 150,000 yearly. I’m sure you gathered this information a long time ago. He couldn’t afford a hand job if he wanted too. He got off that site because I guess he didn’t know that when you sign up on a site like that as a sugar daddy, they make sure you’re legit so, you pay a monthly subscription of $80 and that lets you actually message an unlimited amount of women on the site. Without paying for it, you get literally nothing. Can’t even message a girl. So he ditched that and couple hours later, downloaded tinder and even paid the $15 goddamn dollars for the premium so he could see who swipes right on him. Not sure if I’ve said this yet, but we were NOT divorced whatsoever. Not even close. We haven’t separated, taken a break, spent the night away, none of that. 
So now, I’m fucking fucked in the head, right? Like bad. Don’t even feel like this is reality I’m living in because how in the FUUUUCK can the man I chose to marry, do these things to me and these boys? I am now reaching out to tell my story here, because I am still fighting for this man so hard and he refuses to work with me. When we’re good, he tells me the most reassuring things. Every time we fight he comes back saying how he knows he fucked up and how he’s so sorry and promises to try harder next time. Then the next time comes and he acts the exact same way. Nothing changes. Lately he has been so mean and nasty to me when we’re fighting. I could be hyperventilating on the floor, crying and begging him to just hold me because I’m scared and hurt and he’s still the only person that could make that go away, (fucked how that works, right?) and he could literally look me in the eyes and tell me he’d rather divorce me than hold me. So many occasions I have literally begged for his touch and his love through everything I’ve been dealing with. My mind isn’t good, and I need to be taken care of right now. I tell him this very clearly so many times and he will still choose to do anything else in the world other than help me. I cry myself to sleep hysterically cause I just don’t understand why this is happening all of a sudden, we wake up the next day and it’s back to “I am soooo sorry for all of that I will never do that again I’ll be so much better I love you, you’re perfect and everything I want” so I’m like well, alright if you say so. But you’re really doing me dirty right now, I need you to be better to me especially in my time of need. I’ve always been his rock and he’s been the furthest thing from being mine and it’s bullshit. I expressed this to him very clearly numerous times. Now we’re here on this day, still crying and feeling completely blank and empty and lost and just everything bad in the world, and I have asked him to look me in the eyes as I’m crying and ask him to hold me, and he says no and walks out. “You need some time to yourself.” Boy. What. Anyways to wrap this all up, he’s back to wanting a divorce. This is like the 3rd time he’s said it this week? Not sure how long he’ll go this time without taking it back completely and making me feel whole again before ripping it from me all over again. If you’ve made it this far, I am so so so sorry for how long this is, but it’s my first post and I have never genuinely needed help like this before. I’m so in love I don’t know what to do. Do I stick it out? Wait for him to get back to his old self? Because this is all so new and not him at all. I just want to hold on until this passes but I’m also being completely torn down in the process over and over and the worst part is he can’t even look at me and see the hurt he’s caused me. He’s actually mad at me cause I can’t trust him. Weird, but ok. Help."

Emotional hangover,"Does anyone else get these after opening up to a new person? 

I spent the evening with a new friend and our conversations got pretty deep, and I ended up opening up about my ptsd and my traumas. It was well received and everything went fine. The next morning I woke up feeling terribly insecure and overwhelmed with anxiety. 

I am generally pretty open about my PTSD but usually don't go into details unless someone asks and I trust them. Even so, I always feel so stupid and vulnerable the next day. It's completely exhausting and triggers symptoms. However, I feel like the more often I open up about it the easier it gets. 

I've struggled with PTSD for about seven years and some times in my life are much easier than others. But whenever I wake up feeling shameful for being honest and having to remember everything I've been through, I am reminded that this disorder will exist in me indefinitely."

Advice on requesting CPS/DCFS records?,"Have any of you ever requested CPS/DCFS records?

I won’t go into detail, but when I was in grade school there was an investigation after I had told someone about physical abuse and suicidal thoughts/self harm I was experiencing. I don’t know if it’s a good idea, but I want to see these records to prove that I’m not making this up, I guess. I don’t know if I want closure or am just trying to rehash the same things over and over. How would I even get ahold of these records?? I checked the website of the county office but the advice for requesting records was if you were the parent/adult being investigated. Any advice?"

Question for mods/ other opinions,"Hey all!

Been on here a while and had a comment about the common advice of mdma and psychedelics. 

I firmly understand that they can be beneficial for some but maybe we could just have a thread for people looking down that path? I get it’s helpful to some but it sometimes bothers me that every post looking for advice and or venting about feeling super down almost always has a comment about trying these things. I feel like with the common self healing practice of drugs/alcohol amongst PTSD victims we shouldn’t be so quick to just say “hey have you tried drugs?” I don’t know maybe it’s just me but I feel like when someone’s is talking about wanting to commit suicide or that they are spiraling telling them to go to a dealer and buy stuff they might not know what’s in it is maybe not the best idea.

help please <3,"I need some advice on if what i’m experiencing sounds anything like ptsd or if i have just had a traumatic childhood. for context, i just turned 16 and my parents are the cause of this so i can’t really tell anyone about this or get professional help/diagnosis for another 2 years until i’m 18. My whole childhood my parents have really really hated each other and have been constantly screaming at each other, threatening each other, throwing stuff at each other, and dragging me and my siblings into their fights. Two years ago we were driving home from a road trip and my parents got in an extremely bad fight while driving and my dad was looking through my moms phone so she started grabbing to take it back and kind of hitting him, so he called the cops and my mom freaked the fuck out and made him get out of the car.. which is when things got bad. She was speeding and screaming about how my dad was pyscho and then she said “what if i just killed us all right now” and proceeded to swerve ALMOST off the road literally a foot away from a tree. in that moment i truly believed my mom was going to kill me and all of my siblings and i remember time going by in slow motion and i felt such extreme disappointment and heartbreak in that moment because i didn’t want to die so young. After my mom swerved, i was in shock and she continued to speed until she was in an empty lot and then she got out of the car and had a mental breakdown screaming at the top of her lungs for 30 minutes while me and my brother and sister stayed inside the car petrified. The cops never ended up finding us and as usual, my parents “made up” the next day and acted like nothing had happened. I didn’t realize i was traumatized by it at all until a year later, (last year) i realized how often i would think of her almost killing us and of the perfectly clear image in my head of her headlights shining on the tree a foot ahead of us as she swerved. When i was in cars at night, the road would trigger thoughts and i started to notice i would get extremely anxious and think about the moment my mom swerved and i felt like i was there again. Ever since then, i think about it everyday and when i look at trees that are similar to the ones from that night, or anytime i’m driving at night it triggers me into the flashback-like memory of the event. I was never an anxious person before this but now i am extremely anxious all the time, i have felt depressed for so long i feel numb, and i am constantly reminded of the situation because my parents still fight every day and the noises just bring me back to that car ride. I have never talked about this to anyone because i feel like this event “wasn’t traumatic enough” if that makes sense? i also feel bad because my mom is a victim of my dad (who is mainly the bad guy in their marriage) and her actions were really just because he pushed her to the edge that night.. but i still feel like she doesn’t realize at all how much she scarred me and it hurts. i feel so weak that this one night has ruined my life so much and now i rely on weed to prevent the anxiety i have from this now. if you read all that thank you and i’m sorry if it was jumbled!"

Can We all Agree That Our Mental Illness Is Not An Excuse For Abuse?,"I'm seeing a lot of posts on here with members of this community excusing other members for their blatant abuse of their partners. It is unacceptable.

It is not our fault that we have PTSD but it is out responsibility to keep it in check and not harm others. The amount of blame I'm seeing being put on the partners of members of this community after a person with PTSD has an outburst and abuses them is unsettling at best and triggering at worst.

Imagine if someone was excusing your abuser in this way.

PTSD and being mean,"Hi,

Got noone to really talk to so..
I have known this guy for over a year. We connected very well, mainly due to the fact that we both have ptsd. I am pretty stable but I go through dark periods where I mainly take it out on myself and close myself off. Where he just starts to push people away by being mean. 

I have always considered him as one of my closest friends cause we share alot.

Last night we were talking about our fave videogame. He plays on pc and I do on console. He was going on about me not taking the game serious and not being passionate. I love that game and I am actually among the top players but its not that deep for me. I play to have fun with my friends.
The conversation got weird, i asked him about the vibe he has going on. He told me that I get under his skin. He told me over and over that I don't understand, that I know nothing and to leave him alone. So I did.

I wake up to a bunch of very nasty and degrading messages from him. I got extremely upset cause I dont understand what I have done wrong.
The next day he tells me he is sober, he doesnt remember what happend, he deleted our chat but based on my response it must not have been good.
He tells me he is sorry. He seems genuine.

Only for a an hour later to start talking down on me again and the things I like. He tells me that he would beat up my friend if he ever saw him. I ask him why and he says that I dont understand and its a guy thing. It has to due with respect.

I bought a bread machine and I am really excited and I have been baking loafs and giving them to people. I send him pictures earlier on this week because I wanted to share. He tells me he doesnt care. He cares about making money and status.

At this point I tell him that I'll stop wasting his time then. He tells me that seems like a good idea and says: okay, watch. And he blocks me.

Like I mean nothing. Like our friendship never meant anything. He tells me I am great just to be mean and walk away an hour later?

Is this normal? Is this something I should just accept. I dont understand why someone can be so cruel. I feel horrible.

This has happend 3 times now. And everytime he comes back in a few weeks to apologize and the cycle starts again.

How to heal?,"I’ve gone though chronic bullying from middle to high school. I also developed an illness called TMAU where it makes me distance myself from everyone and led to even more bullying an embarrassment. 

This led to detachment depression social anxiety and emotional numbness.

Right now, it’s weird, I just feel emotionally detached from everyone.  Every time I see someone I get panicky, maybe seeing someone is a trigger now which is problematic. I feel just spaced out. Like I could be doing something and in my head I’m like not even focusing I it instead, I’m playing an old song in my head or just thinking about something else. I’m not present.
Just going outside makes me fucking super anxious and I’m super weird around people now.  Is this disassociating? I feel like it’s gotten out of hand. I am constantly like this 24/7.

I was never like this! This is very problematic.

What Defines PTSD?,"I'm wondering what makes PTSD, well, PTSD. I know that not all of you are professionals here, so if you don't know the criteria or anything much to do with this, that's okay. I'm good with hearing stories, if you're okay with providing that.

Basically, I question this because I was told I have a bunch of symptoms for PTSD by my therapist, but wasn't diagnosed. She said she didn't like to diagnose younger people (I was 17, I'm 18 now) with it. She said I get flashbacks, I have trauma, and experience the symptoms for PTSD.

Can’t Remember Days,"Hello, everyone.

Just a thing I was wondering if anyone else could relate to, I guess. Ever since I got cPTSD, I have a hard time remembering the day prior, but especially nights. It takes me hours to recall what I did or who I was with, or where I was. I know that I dissociate a lot, but I don’t know if if I’ve just been dissociating so often that I’m just doing it all the time now, or is it something else ??

I think we really need to figure out a new way to help phobias cause exposure therapy might just make it worse. As far post traumatic stress, oh ya trust me nothing makes me feel more traumatic stress than the memories of ""exposure therapy""."
Don't let an act of cowardice define your life,"I'm writing this is the hope that it will make a difference in someone else's life. Someone who's facing the same dilemma, or will face the dilemma, that I did. This happened some time ago, so it's too late for me. But I'm hoping it's not too late for you. I was assaulted over a simple argument by a guy I knew, who was in the same friend circle. Needless to say, I called the cops after the incident and filed a police report. But when it came to pressing charges, I decided against it. Why did I decide against it? Because my friends told me there will be consequences and not to ruin his life over a momentary impulsive action. Because I didn't want to relive the act out in court, and face the dirty tactics that his expensive lawyers would undoubtedly employ. But most importantly, because I feared he would retaliate once he got out. If you're ever faced with such a decision, please face your fears and do the right thing. You will be thankful for it in the long term. Don't let other people persuade you. Trust your instincts. If your friends are telling you to think about the consequences for her/him, then they are not looking out for you, they are looking out for her/him. Most importantly, if you're worried he/she will react in a bad way and retaliate, then you will live your life in shame and regret, as I am doing right now. I'm now struggling with crippling anxiety and PTSD to the point that I cannot function normally. In the weeks following the attack, I no longer had an appetite and ate barely a meal a day, sometimes not even that. I didn't do my everyday chores, like laundry and dish washing. My house was a disgusting mess. I had no interest and still have no interest in meeting my friends and doing things I once enjoyed, like rock climbing and skiing. But these are not the things that bother me the most. These things return to some sort of normalcy, or at least I hope. What bothers me most is that I took a wrong decision for the wrong reasons, and I will have to live with this forever. It still haunts me. It affects the way I see myself. It affects everything from my self-worth to my everyday decision-making. It affects things as simple as approving my coworkers designs or providing constructive criticism. I tell myself everyday that I should not be worried and will not be worried about their reactions. But, the fact that I didn't take the right decision back in the day has handicapped me. It has killed my dreams and aspirations, because I fear that I will take the wrong call when faced with a tough decision. My dating life is a mess, because I fear that I'm not a strong person and I'm incapable of protecting the woman I am with. I have let fear take over my life, and all this because of one act of cowardice. Please, do not let this happen to you. Don't let an act of cowardice define your life."
Help with coping with anger problems,"Due to very unfortunate circumstances(a very long and depressing story) I found myself in prison during the fall of 2018. While I was locked up, I was forced by my environment to frequently be very violent and aggressive, and often had to do things I’m not proud of. As of now, I’m currently studying at a university (ironically enough, psychology with intent of going to law school). I tend to have issues dealing with my anger. In December of 2018 I was formally diagnosed with PTSD, but I figured if I just tried to act normal, it’d go away. Surprise, that didn’t work. Does anyone have any healthy coping techniques for dealing with anger?"

I really don't like this post because the OP plays with other's psychology and want's only support and no questions. 

>Can We all Agree That Our Mental Illness Is Not An Excuse For Abuse?

No. We can't - and why do you try to create a group thinking only one way? I'm not part of ""We"" just because a loaded and biased question is asked. I remain ""I"".

That question forces a black or white response to something that is not black of white. It shuts down thought, debate and promotes the view of the author as the only way to think correctly. 

Why did the OP use the question/Interrogative form? Because it closes down debate or any insight that Undermines the Blalck and White mindset promoted by the question. The answers are Yes Or No and no debate.

The Question is a ""[Thought-terminating cliché](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Thought-terminating_clich%C3%A9)"" - something used in brainwashing and manipulation. People who read it and don't agree suffer cognitive dissonance and unease. The quickest way to stop that is to just agree.

I confronted my attacker,"This is my first post to reddit and I don't know if this belongs here

This pertains to just one (of many) sexual assualts that have happened to me in my life. And perhaps the sheer number of incidences that I, and many others experience in their lifetime, is the reason I did this

The incident at hand happened a few years ago as I was starting my new life in a city where I knew absolutely nobody

I won't post a discription with too many details, especially if they are triggering. Recently though, a friend from that night brought it up and revealed two crucial details that I didn't know until now. 1: My attacker tried to pay someone $100 to leave me alone with him, and 2: He was recently deported back to his home country 

It was a crazy mix of emotions having that night brought up again, learning that he actually tried to PAY SOMEONE to get me alone, and learning he was booted out of the country to top it all off. I felt retraumatized, enraged, and ecstatic all at once

I spent the day wishing it could all go away again where I had buried it, that I could have been better off not knowing about the money, etc. And then I had an idea. What if I called him out for what he did? He hasn't had a care or second thought about that night when I've had countless. To him he's gotten away with it, but I can take that back

So I found his Facebook profile and sent him a message. To sum it up, I told him it was great news he was deported as I would never have to see him again, but that he should not assault any women out there. I told him I knew about the money and he's lucky the cops were never involved. I called him a predator, and outlined exactly who he was and why he got what he deserved. I was a little more colorful in my language in some parts but it was very short and to the point. 

I know that some might say this isn't ""taking the high road"" but until then I had been silenced by my own guilt and shame. He had been walking around thinking nothing of that night and moving on with his life. I gave myself the only thing I could to move on with mine: a voice to call him out for what he did, who he is. He's a predator and karma served him right

To this day I had never thought about contacting anyone who has harmed me. Outlining to him who he was and wishing him good riddance has lifted a great weight off of my shoulders and I finally feel like I can move on"
The DA has decided to file charges against one of the people who broke into my condo and stole my brothers camera.,"I’m both relieved and I’m incredibly nervous.

Broken into by the brother (Punk #1) of my dads friend and this brothers friend (Punk #2). Punk 2 pawned my brothers camera, and the detective recovered it. Punk 1 didn’t pawn anything, so they have no evidence to pin him to the scene. 

I’m nervous because I know I have to relive the shock again. I’m nervous because I know I have to relive the anxiety attacks caused by that moment, because I have to deal with the recurring memories of that moment, that make me think of that condo and cause me to have attacks."

I'm so goddamn fed up with this. I was triggered big time last night, *right after SO and I had an argument*. 
The argument was over something completely trivial, but as it happened we drove through a certain location, the very one where my worst (sexual) assault took place. I thought nothing of it at first, but then I started to feel that choking sensation that always precedes a major panic attack.

My already-ornery SO assumes I'm being a bitch and giving him the silent treatment, gets angry and starts raising his voice and telling me off for ""being like that"".
Meanwhile I *cannot* get a word out of my mouth, I'm shaking --almost convulsing-- with tears running down my face, starting to hyperventilate.
SO is red-faced and cursing at this point.
Tells me to stop being moody.
Just as we turn to the supermarket parking lot, I manage to say ""panic attack"" in between wheezes.
He stares at me, goes ""hrmph!"" and goes to grab his cheese puffs.
By the time he gets back I've vomited all over myself. 
He's still obviously cranky, but pats me on my leg (which makes me jump; he huffs at me again) and drives home.

After I've struggled free of the seat belt (not exactly easy when your hands are both violently shaking and weak as shit) I run upstairs and collapse into the bed.
I hyperventilate until I pass out, then retch, cry and hyperventilate again.
At this point SO realizes I'm not ""making a scene"" as he put it, and brings me a bag to breathe in. 
After some of that and a dose of lorazepam it passes, but I feel exhausted for the rest of the evening and go to bed early.
I have nightmares and a sleep paralysis episode.
Eventually I wake up to find that I have, once again, shredded my arms. I don't know why, but during these sleep disorders I tend to scratch and bite the hell out of my arms.
They're now sore as hell and look like I've been wrestling with a ball of razor wire.
I hate it when this happens!
I have enough scars already; now there will be more. 
I get all sorts of questions about them. 
No, I don't cut, for the billionth time. 
No, I do not abuse my cats (seriously?!). 
No, my SO doesn't hurt me. 

Can I not just go about my life without some stupid little thing (sudden move or sound, certain scents, locations, strangers getting too close etc.) triggering me? 
I don't want all those questions or fingers pointing at me.
I don't want to be pitied, or laughed at.
I don't want to tear myself to pieces at night, or to have nightmares pretty much every single night.
I don't want my SO or anyone else to think I'm being a drama queen.
I don't want to be constantly conflicted and lacking both trust and confidence.
I don't want to go out only to immediately start looking for an escape route.

I feel like a goddamn prisoner.

Oh, I've looked and applied for psychotherapy. Even getting approved took forever; they keep you wait-listed while a bunch of bureaucrats try to decide whether you're sick or not.
Once I was approved, turned out that there are only so many therapists around, and they have more patients than they can handle.
""Sorry, we're full"". Back to the waiting game.

And trying to report someone for assaulting you? Good luck with that around here. They'll only say it was your own fault and leave it at that."

What should I do?,"Ok so very recently I started seeing a therapist because I think I have depression or anxiety or maybe both(I'm not sure, the labels are new to me). While I was there one day she said these things could be a result of trauma. Part of me knew that my troubles were from effect of being sexually assaulted by 2 different men when I was in elementary school. I have buried those memories so far down and ignored them so hard I thought they couldnt hurt me but now i cant escape them and I realize I may have ptsd. I'm really not sure how to bring this up to anyone. I have never told anyone about this because the 2 men are extremely close to my family. I'm not sure how to keep it anonymous if I tell anyone. I hate this because I am trapped with what they've done and telling others what they've done would just be so messy and could ruin a lot of things. That's what has kept me from talking about it sooner. Do u think I could tell my therapist without her questioning the identities? But also the fact that were so close to me makes me so angry and upset so how do I address that with he? Would it be investigated? Because I dont think I want it to be. Will I be able to move on??

"Concern husband may have PTSD, how can I help?","Hey everyone,

This will be a long winded post, so I apologize in advance. However, I really do need some honest advice and thoughts about my current situation.

For background, I'm a 34 year old gay man, married to my partner of nine years. My husband is 30 years old. We've had a relatively healthy and strong relationship together for most of these nine years. However, something is definitely wrong within our relationship at this point, and I am trying to determine exactly what is going on. I've developed concerns lately that he may be a child sex abuse survivor, and may have a certain amount of PTSD from his childhood.

I know for a fact my husband was physically and emotionally abused by his father growing up. A good amount of this abuse may have been caused by my husband being gay. He's a little more effeminate. I've never met his father, as his mother and father had a divorce when my husband was in his teens. His father forced him to go to counseling around the time of the divorce, which from what I gather, seemed to have an element of ""conversion therapy"" to it.

My husband doesn't like to talk about emotional and personal things. Throughout our relationship, if he is in a bad mood or something is wrong, his response is to deny it, become quiet and clam up, even though his body language and facial expressions say the exact opposite. Regardless how patient and non-judgmental I try to come across, he will not discuss things that are bothering him.

Another thing I have noticed throughout the time I have known my husband, is that he has an aversion to public restrooms. If we are out in public and he needs the restroom, there is a good chance he will hold it until we return home, even if it is uncomfortable. He will go sometimes depending on where we are, but it is very evident it is an uncomfortable thing for him.

Within the past year, I have noticed several ""episodes"" when I am interacting with my husband. In these episodes, his tone changes, his facial expressions change, and it is almost like he becomes a different person for a time period of seconds, to a minute. They are very fast episodes.

For example, over the summer, my husband and I were outside in our backyard, enjoying the evening. I cannot remember exactly what we were talking about, however, I believe the subject of his dad had come up several times recently. Suddenly, my husband pointed to a place on his leg where there was a scar. His face became angry, and he commented to me ""see this spot on my leg? This is where you stabbed me"". He paused, then said ""just kidding...that's where my dad stabbed me"". Shortly after, his tone and persona became relaxed and ""normal"" again. That episode scared me. I've never hurt my husband, and the intensity on his face, and the comment truly worry me. It felt like he was a different person for a moment.

My husband has been having a lot of problems at work lately. He is getting bullied and harrassed by coworkers that has escalated to where he has filed grievances with HR. Last night, when he came home, he began crying. He said he didn't want to talk about it and that he would be fine. He has begun self-medicating with marijuana, and smoked last night to calm his nerves. I've told him a few times he should really consider changing jobs. He does not want to because of his income, and he does not want his coworkers to feel they won by running him off. While I respect his decisions, I truly believe his work environment is damaging him at this point.

After calming down last night, he had another few ""episodes"". We were watching TV, and he began talking and venting about clients at work. He and I both work with the public, and have interacted with substance users throughout our careers. He began commenting about a client who he felt was a meth user. As we both began describing the physical appearance and behaviors of methamphetamine users, my husband's tone changed again. His face became intense, and he jabbed his finger into my chest somewhat hard to get my attention and began demonstrating what I'm guessing was a client he dealt with at work. He scrunched his face up, rolled his eyes up for what felt like at least thirty seconds. It almost felt like he was having some sort of seizure. I began to feel disturbed and uncomfortable before he stopped and leaned back on the couch. He became quiet and somewhat withdrawn for several minutes after.

A few minutes later, as we were watching Wild Wild West the movie, I made a comment about the Victrola speaker being used as a hearing aide for one of the characters. My husband then made a comment that ""they used to do that"". Again, his face became intense and somewhat angry, and he made a comment about using nails and hammering a victrola speaker into someone's head. He then said ""Bang, bang bang!!"" very loud and intense. Again, it felt like was a different person. Shortly after, his demeanor changed again, and he was calm, but withdrawn.

He and I are getting into arguments almost weekly at this point. He made comments last summer that he hates himself, feels stressed and doesn't know what to do. He has begun working out lifting weights, got his ears pierced, and is trying to improve his appearance. For at least six months, he has appeared to have an aversion to sex with me. He has a hard time getting an erection, and comments that sex sometimes feels forced.

At this point, I question a few things. I wonder if he is a survivor of child sex abuse, that has come to light in his growth and development within the past year. He may be fighting demons that he does not feel comfortable talking to me about. I also question if he is not sexually attracted to me anymore, but is afraid to end things, or be honest with me. 

I know this is a long post. If you've read this far, thank you. Do these behaviors seem like a type of PTSD? I want to help, and I truly think he needs help. How can I offer my support without making things worse?"
"I would like someone to talk to, please help keep my mind positively engaged","The content of my post may be triggering, just want to disclaim first and foremost. I apologise if this is not allowed here and I'll take my post down if asked. I'm looking for someone to talk to about anything. I'll offer a bit of background to my situation. I worked as a first responder since 2011 (fire/EMS) and in 2012 or possibly 2013 (I don't remember), I started working in the CVICU's at Cleveland Clinic's main campus. We saw some of the sickest patients in the world. We would have patients flown in from the middle East, Europe, all over the world. Anyways, I was in ICU for about 5 years, the last two I spent incredibly ill from Crohn's disease. I was an inch away from agreeing to Major surgery at one point. I got sick enough where I couldn't work fire/EMS any longer and lost my job in the ICU. I was in so much chronic pain, trying to help the sick and dying.


I finally found a medication that works and started working full time again, recently. I've had my fiance to support me the whole way through. I haven't been diagnosed yet, but I have a lot of the signs and symptoms of PTSD. I get night terrors, I can't stand going out in public most of the time, I have trouble sleeping and focusing on my work. My mind just reaches and I'm perpetually anxious. Every night, I just start crying out of nowhere and I'm always irritated and agitated, but I try really hard to not let others bother me. I'm terrified and paranoid at night, I don't even know why. Like I keep my apartment door locked, but it's gotten so bad that some nights I sleep with my handgun. I feel like I'm not able to function like I should be. There's more, but I'll just keep it here. I would really like someone to just bullshit with."
Someone give me some encouragement,"I woke up the morning of August 2nd at 4 am to screaming.... then all of a sudden pounding on my apartment door. I look in the peep hole and see bright orange open the door and flames coming out of my neighbors door and already a section in the corner of my door. It was so hot I shut the door grabbed my phone and got out a window (on ground level). Just trying to process how they got out and call 911. The building ended up being condemned.

This was almost six months ago now but what has ensued after this I’m tired of dealing with. I’ve been able to live life. I bought a house pass two parts of the CPA exam and go to work.... but chest pain started happening. I had a panic attack one night went to the emergency room. Went to heart center next day bc emergency room said it was a requirement. APRN told me everything was fine. Told her I already had a therapist. Did what she told me started to feel better. More nervy chest pain came back. I was running on a treadmill one night and my heart just had a nerve stressed feeling. Next day went to a clinic where she prescribed me venlaxafine. Had a stress test yesterday said my heart was great, but now my blood pressure is astronomical. Spoke to the clinic she increased my dosage of venlaxafine from 37.5 mg to 75mg. 

I’m tired of worrying about my health when nothing is wrong. I just want to go back to how I feel before the fire. Chest pains have pretty much been not there since starting the medicine. But I just feel down. Are things ever going to be normal again? There was one night I had convinced myself as I was going to sleep I wasn’t waking up in the morning.

Today my dad sent me a message that’s it’s time to move past this and I can talk to him. I don’t even know what to describe. I just feel not normal and down with an increased heightened state... to all you fighting God bless. I could use some comments that things will get better. They already are, but at the same time I know how I felt before the fire and that was a way better feeling than how I feel now"

Now that I am in the hospital I can't do that and I don't know what to do, the nurses are giving me the lowest dose of medication and it doesn't help at all, I am trying my best but I get hurt everyday, only smoking cigarette help a bit but I can't do that all day.

My mother recently decided to steal my dog and continuously talks about me and my personal mental illness struggles(suicidal ideation,etc) to my siblings and dad to the point where no one in my family wants to talk to me anymore. She is like the queen bee that always has to have her way. 

My parents are divorced by the way yet she still has a hold over my dad because he is still in love with her even though he couldn’t quit drinking or gambling or smoking or any of his issues for our family.

Most recently, my mom decided to steal my dog from me after having her babysit him for a week and told me not to come to her house anymore because I’d be trespassing so I can’t even see my dog. Told me if I want him back I’d need to take her to court (so in the process of this now- really didn’t want to do it but had no other choice). I adopted him and have all the paperwork and the cops in the area won’t help me get him back because she’s also a cop even though she’s not allowed to work anymore until Cleared by a psychologist which I think is unlikely to happen.

She consistently blames all dysfunction in the family on my BPD which was likely caused by family issues so it just seems like a never ending blame game in my family.

Is there any hope for this situation? I recently saw some texts pop up on my dads phone and it was unlocked so I honestly invaded privacy to see what was going on behind my back and the things my mom was saying about me were devastating. Accusing me of not being able to foster healthy relationships, etc, basically anything you’ll google on BPD that’s negative she’ll throw at other people and me to hurt me somehow.

I really don’t know what to do anymore, seems like a lost cause.

Is this normal behaviour for parents to bash their kids to their kids faces and to each other and get siblings in on anything.

Right now my mom has convinced everyone in the family that the dog is better off with her and I’m once again the bad guy because I’m suing her for the dog back."
Accidentally triggered myself,"[trigger warning--rape, abuse, self harm] I was talking on the addiction subreddit about my issues with self harm and promiscuity at a young age; and I've dealt with the fact that it's tied to a few events, my moms birthday and a party I went to when I was 14 that I was raped.

 But someone asked a question about why I stopped self harming and I thought about it for a while, and it unlocked a very unpleasant memory for me of my abuser(long term bf at the time) checking my body for marks. 

I've spiraled into a deep depression for the past few days because of it and my partner was very confused but understanding.  I know that dealing with my trauma is the way to healing but what I would give to erase some of the things I remember.

This is somehow one of the worst because of my shame with NSSI behavior and my shame of talking about his control over me. Ugh."
Can’t trust my thoughts,"My partner does not open up. In the sense of there will never be acknowledgement if she does something wrong and either doesn’t possess the ability to self reflect to the point where she will be vulnerable so it just leaves me feeling confused. When I’m trying to talk to her about a serious matter and she refuses to open up and I’m left being open and vulnerable because your taught in therapy not to hold stuff in but talk about how you feel it is very scary, and confusing. For someone to just tell you you’re imagining things when your ptsd actually causes really bad paranoia and disassociation it’s makes me not trust my mind and it makes me confused and angry that she doesn’t try to understand me by connecting to me openly it leaves me
Vulnerable and confused. I considered just ending it with myself because that’d be the way out of it. 

I don’t think she realizes her inability to be open and vulnerable is killing me. It confuses me so much I think I either went into a manic episode or still in it iono
I thought I was getting better"
Today marks a year since my event (possible triggers),"Exactly a year ago today I was abducted and robbed at knife point.

I didn't even know that it was today until my mom brought it up in the car while we were out shopping, a week ago I had something trigger me and I'd been having nightmares, flashbacks and possible scenarios plaguing me ever since, I've been dealing with anxiety since I was about 11 years old, so my brain coming up with every possible way something can go wrong is pretty normal to me. But lately I've been picturing myself dying and although I felt like I wanted to die a year ago, because everything was just too much, I've decided that I don't wanna die and I don't want to live in fear. I'm happier now, I have a boyfriend who is so supportive and understanding and I want to be there for him to repay him for everything he does for me with all the love in my heart. I have a mother who needs me and I don't want to let her down. Deep down though, I still get the urge, when things are a little too much but right now, thinking about what everyone else around me might need keeps me from taking that leap.

I'm glad that I have people that need me, even if they don't know how much I need them"
Any tips on preventing night terrors?,"Most of my night terrors are from being a CSA survivor and if I go to bed anxious about literally anything It really fucks me up. Smoking weed really helps me calm down before bed and give me a good nights rest. Only problem is I’m almost out of what I’ve bought and I’m kinda broke rn and I should probably find a less expensive way to cope. Any suggestions? 

The symptoms of my night terrors usually involve a lot of panic, hurting myself in my sleep (scratching biting I’ll wake up with bruises ect.) disassociation and anxiety when I wake up and wetting the bed sometimes."

I'm lost in the past,"I'm lost

I don't feel human anymore. this usually lasts a few hours to a day but it's been almost a week and nothing has felt okay.

newly unrepressed csa memories have been really really affecting me and my ptsd and I currently just feel so disconnected from reality, myself, everything. time either moves incredibly fast or painfully slow, I relapsed and felt nothing, I straight up have no idea how to cope with these new memories.

we had a huge snowstorm so my therapy was cancelled this week so I've been left on my own trapped in my house, my friend is with me currently but I feel so alienated and uncomfortable in my own skin that I start freaking out at random.

does anyone have any advice for... anything? I honestly have no idea what to do anymore, grounding isnt working but I can't keep going on like this."
"Advice please? Dealing with a difficult situation at work, would appreciate guidance or just your thoughts or something. Think I might quit my job.","Just wanted to get some advice on a situation at work, that I don’t really know how to deal with. I’m 27 F.

I have a work partner 40s Male (we work on an ambulance) who is very difficult to work with. My main difficulty is that he is very angry and will throw things and try and break stuff...like the tablet keyboard or radios we use in the front. I’ve asked him to stop, he still does it. I don’t want to have to explain myself on why it bothers me though. He doesn’t know I have PTSD. Another thing is that he’s incredibly belittling and impatient and makes me feel like the most incompetent person ever. Previous partners have never made me feel this way. 

I just came off of an eight week FMLA leave partly due to this stressful partner making it difficult at work. Tonight I told my supervisor about this difficulty who was understanding and knows of PTSD but said that they have to have a conversation with him before they even think of splitting us up and so the plan would be to all of us to talk our issues out in the morning and then go on our 12 hour shift STRAIGHT AFTER. And I just don’t think my partner is going to be receptive since he hasn’t proven that to be the case before. And he’s just a plain old asshole. I don’t think I can spend 12 hours more with him. I think he’ll act it up in the office then make it hell during shift. He’s the type. 

My instinct is to just quit and leave. I had been looking for another job before tonight but this just might be my tipping  point.

What would you do in this awkward position? Have you ever experienced a similar situation? I feel scared."
Dog Surgery,"My dog, a 10-year-old, female Tervuren, that I've have had since she was ten weeks old, had surgery today to remove a small growth on her right paw; it could be cancerous. 

Statistically, only 35% of all dogs make it to age 11.

The procedure went well, but I won't have results back for some time.

Having her around has really helped my symptoms and allows me to sleep well at night, and our walks and our trips to the dog park are about the only things that get me out of the house on weekends.

I've already decided that I'll get another dog when she goes, but I'm hoping I'll have her for three more years when I can retire and have more time to work the new dog.

She's been a wonderful companion and she deserves a pain free life and honorable death, so I will see that she is well cared for and do the necessary thing when the time comes.

Thank you for taking your time to read this.

TW: my abuser,"It's been two years since I was sexually abused. I was not raped, but heavily manipulated and coerced to do things I wasn't comfortable with. The school dealt with it very poorly. But, I reported it several months after it happened. Keep in mind, all of the physical abuse happened in the school. 

I blame myself for what happened. I let him treat me like that because I wanted someone to care for me and think I was special. While some may argue it's not my fault, I was simply searching for love in any way I could find it, and he abused that. But it just doesn't sit well with me. Isn't it still may fault for being naive?

My family and friends are very supportive, but I'm not sure how to be okay. I'm very suicidal from the events that happened and I'm not sure how far I'm going to make it. I don't want to suffer.

At times the flashbacks are so bad I'm left shaking and sobbing, covering myself with as much as I can. I do things that I later regret because I convince myself he was watching me. 

I'm just so tired of fighting my mind, I feel like I shouldn't have to convince myself he doesn't still own me. 

Anyway, thank you for listening. <3"
Nightmares and night terrors,"It's been about six months since I've had a full night terror attack but I have nightmares and replay memories when I fall asleep. My boyfriend has to wake me almost nightly, several times a night, because I start twitching, kicking, and hyperventilating in my sleep. I'm scared to sleep and I feel bad that I wake him and interrupt his rest with my baggage. 
I don't know what to do. I'm so tired all the time  but even the thought of sleeping is sometimes enough to push me into a panic attack."
not sure if my “traumatic event” qualifies,"one night i has the worse anxiety attack of my life and was in such a distressed state that i literally did not feel like myself. the feeling was completely foreign and scary. i started feeling like i was losing control and didn’t recognize myself anymore and started to panic that i would hurt someone. i contemplated suicide. looking back the feeling of not recognizing myself and feeling like i lost touch with myself and the world around my might have been derealization. but, nevertheless, it still was scary as hell. i was convinced i needed to go to the hospital and be locked up because i was unpredictable in this state. ever since that attack i have not felt the same. i am constantly afraid of falling back into that state. i recall that night all the time. i feel changed after experiencing that feeling and that state. i feel a sense of wrongness with my identity and the world around me which i think stems from me feeling like a different person after the attack. i also associate physical things to the attack which trigger me to recall the event. i had the breakdown in my closet, bathroom, and mother’s room and now i avoid my moms room all together. every time i walk into my bathroom or closet i am taken straight back to that night and that feeling. also, there are many physical things that i won’t know are triggers until i interact with them. for example, if i’m doing my laundry and i come upon the shirt i was wearing when i has the breakdown, it will trigger me. 

so, while i relate to some major symptoms, i’m not sure that event would be considered traumatic enough. it may just be some high functioning anxiety. please comment ur opinion"
I didn’t put 2 and 2 together till recently and I’m not sure how to proceed.,"When I was around 5 I went to an older friends birthday party at a hotel. While swimming at the pool I ended up jumping into the deep end and knocking out. I woke up to a man doing chest compressions and mouth to mouth on me. 

I’m now 27, and throughout my life whenever I go swimming in waters were I feel I can’t reach the bottom or get to a ledge quickly my body starts to panic and I start to breath more sporadic and take on water. 

It was only through a conversation a few months ago that I realized this may be some form of symptoms due to my early childhood experience. I would like to say that I am an avid swimmer and good at keeping myself afloat in water, it just something in more open waters that my body doesn’t like and tends to freak out.

So the reason I’m posting this is because I’m wondering if there is anything I can really do about this. Are there ways to curb my subconscious response to the deep blue or am I just bound to struggle with this indefinitely? I appreciate you reading this and taking the time to respond."

Bessel Van Der Kolk: How trauma lodges in the body.,"Hi, i'm new here and still working up the courage to open up properly, but recently something happened which sent me on a bit of a journey and I thought others may find this useful.

To give a bit of loose background I've had a real problem experiencing emotions due to past trauma. I have been numb for as long as I can remember.

I have recently had the fortune to be able to afford and work with a great therapist. He has pointed me in the direction of some recent studies into mindfulness and yoga for assisting the treatment of ptsd and c-ptsd. 

I started yoga at his recommendation (with some scepticism) and have had some really profound results regarding my mental health.

This prompted me to do further research and I came across this interview with Bessel Van Der Kolk who covers the subject of how trauma is being treated through teaching people to reconnect with their bodies:

Having a hard time lately.,"Time has felt so distorted lately and I can’t tell if it’s been a couple days or a month.  Flashbacks have been throwing me off also, it could feel like hours as I’m reliving my trauma, but it’s only been a couple minutes. Is anyone else dealing with this? Any tips on how to cope?"
How to Cope With Going Back to the Hospital,"I’ll try to make a long story short and get straight to my question.

When I was I 10 had a very big surgery that went wrong. I was in the hospital for 2 weeks and had two major surgeries in that time span. After that, I lived with the botched surgery for a year before something went wrong. I went back to the doctor and tried to tell them this. He wanted to do exploratory surgery, my mom did not. 3 procedures later, one with my old doctor and two with the new, we found the problem. 

Another surgery to fix the originally botched one. 2 months of recovery ahead of me. A year and a half after that, another medical issue. Another surgery. 

Basically, I have hospital-related PTSD. As someone with a chronic medical condition, hospitals are unavoidable. In a week, I’m due for a procedure that is a very big trigger for me. It is unavoidable as it is to check for something that could be very dangerous if it goes unnoticed. I’m too young to take any medication like Xanax to calm myself down before I go. 

TLDR: I have hospital-related PTSD and need recommendations for how to cope with having to go back for a procedure that’s extremely traumatic for me without drugs, as I have to be awake for the procedure."
Exerpt: Consequences of lack of love. Made me cry,"Love is something that is learnt from birth.
If love is freely given to a child that child will freely give it, if it isn't given at all, they wont give it, they wont know how and if they are given it by one parent but not the other, they will always search for the love not received in other people but they'll never truly accept it, because they never believed they were ever worthy of it.

If the parents love is given too late, the same is true. 


The first 1000 days of a child's life are crucial for attachment. If the child has not attached by that point, they either never will or will always struggle.
If there were issues in that attachment up to the end of those 1000 days, that child will struggle with relationships for the rest of their lives unless serious intervention is had and even then, it wont be effortless for them."

"Curcumin, Compound In Turmeric, Found To Impair Fear Memories And Ease PTSD Symptoms",">Turmeric is a main spice in curry — it's a yellow-colored, bitter-tasting ginger root that can also be quite medicinal. Turmeric has been used to treat arthritis, heartburn, stomach issues, and diarrhea, among other things throughout human history — but now researchers have found a new potential outlet for the root in treating disorders involving fear memories, like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
>
>In a new study (*2014*) led by Glenne Schafe, a professor of psychology at Hunter College, researchers found that curcumin — the principal compound found in turmeric — impaired the formation of fear memories in the brain after a traumatic experience.
>
>“We showed that rats freely fed a diet enriched with curcumin have impaired encoding of fear memories,” Schafe said in the press release. “We also showed that rats with a pre-existing fear memory can lose that memory when it is recalled while they are eating a curcumin-enriched diet.”

ptsd affecting my relationships,"i’ve been noticing more and more that the way i deal with conflict resolution w friends is really not effective and has everything to do with how my mom would treat me during our fights. i get caught in this pattern of thinking and feel like i have to protect myself even when the other person doesn’t feel like there’s any argument going on; basically i’ve become very hypervigilant. i feel extremely guilty when this happens because it’s only after the fact that i realize i’m living out my past, and by that point the damage has already been done. i don’t mean any harm to the other person when this happens, it’s legitimately just me trying to protect myself, but it’s so scary to me because the last thing i want to do is follow this generational trauma pattern in my family and become the abusive person my mom is/was (not that i’ve been abusive to my friends, it’s far from that, but i’m worried it could become that someday).

I was run over by a car last June, and still struggle daily with crossing the road etc. So I get off the bus, cross at the crosswalk, make it to the sidewalk and I'm just walking along - and I don't notice there is a driveway tucked behind some trees. All of a sudden, a green civic is next to me - he's slamming on his breaks, and the car stops maybe a foot away from me.

Needless to say, i freaked out - took off at a jog (was carrying all my shit, laptop bag, tote - couldn't run) and fumbled around for my phone. I was getting dizzy, and the sun felt too bright all of a sudden. Finally claw my phone out of my bag, and call my SO. He lets me mumble and cry at him for a minute, then helps me calm down with some deep breathing. I get off the phone, and I see there is a little black lab puppy tied up outside the store I'm in front of. So without even thinking about it, I went up to this little guy and started petting and hugging him. He calmed right down and got super cuddly, licked my face and generally was a very good boi. I just sorta held him and cried a little, and then went and got my coffee. 

Now I'm sorta tired, have a lump in my throat, and kinda just want to curl up in bed. But I'm grateful for my little puppy friend."

When you think you're okay...,"Could be over 10 years later and you bump into someone and all of the air drains from the room and you can feel the blood drop from your face and the chills and shakes set in and then it takes tears, nightmares, flashbacks and days to recover. 

You think it's so under control and doesnt matter anymore and haven't had an episode in a long time but it's always there lurking under the surface ready to strike...how can something that happened over a decade ago have shattered my psyche so much that people, places, events and memories are just left as horrible triggers that I attempt to keep buried. 

Years ago I would never admit to mental health issues such as ptsd, anxiety and depression...it was also treated so much differently and you were just drugged into oblivion and kept it under the rug. The anxiety, agitation and depression like to rear their ugly head sometimes and it's just too hard to fight back so you fall into a pit of despair that takes awhile to get out of, but at least I get out and for that I'm a little stronger than I was.  I haven't taken anything in years but I wish there was a magical cure all for everyone for how broken trauma can make you feel.

First psychiatrist appointment didn’t go so well,"Rant! So - I had my first psychiatrist appointment today and I’m upset. Basically the doc was dismissing my past experiences of child abuse and assault; writing it off as depression and anxiety disorder; was even questioning what I said happened because I “was only 3 years old”; and that I should let go of the past and concentrate on the present. Man, seriously I went there to get help and now I feel worse."
I feel alone. Any advice?,"Hey guys. So back in December my therapist diagnosed me with ptsd, depression and anorexia (the last two are linked to the first). To give a little background as to why I deal with ptsd its because while my brother and I were growing up he dealt with tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures for roughly 8 years. Unfortunately I often fell witness to his episodes. A lot of scarring memories came out of these years and I deal with flashbacks and nightmares on a daily basis. 

Anyways, my main issue right now is that I feel really alone in my experience and don’t know how to help it. It only makes me feel more depressed and hopeless when I think about the fact that I’ve never heard of anyone with a story similar to mine and don’t have anyone to relate to.

Im sorry there is so much here but i havent been able to talk to anyone and its starting to tear me apart. I have constant nightmares about the night i got stabbed, the gun being held to my head, every word they said to me, everything. I dont know what to do and i cant bring myself to see a therapist because i very honestly just dont like being out in public anymore. I am scared shitless of anything pressurized to the point where you can watch me visibly cringe when soda is opened and stuff like that. I had nightmares about my abusive mother for years and ive started coping with it i believe? I havent dreamed of her house in at least 6 months. And does anyone else have dreams that resemble their trauma greatly but not to an exact? I have had a reoccuring one where i walk into a restaurant of some sort and a man stands up and swings a baseball bat against my head, forcing me to relieve how it felt to be struck and knocked out that day of my head injury. But all of this happened so long ago and i hadnt really dealt with ptsd from alot of it until the past 2 or 3 years. But thats not saying alot cause both the injuries have happened in the last 5 years.

I feel like im spamming and id like to let people know you are free to ask questions. My main goal is to find out why its taken so long for me to start bring affected by it."
I don't want a relationship with my Mother,"Hey all,

So I've got some pretty bad ptsd whenever I get around my mom. She always makes me anxious and scared cause I know that any moment she can snap. She's been diagnosed with a lot of things and doesn't regularly take her meds. So chaos ensues.


My dad keeps saying that I should have a relationship with her because she's my mom and blah blah blah. To me that's toxic af and like I can't believe how stupid he is to suggest that knowing all the things she's done. My sister still maintains a relationship though, I guess she has more empathy than me."
Encouragement and positive advice needed: Panicking about invasive medical procedure this Friday (Potentially triggering),"I have to get a transvaginal ultrasound by a complete stranger I've never met before. I have ptsd from being abused by medical providers. I read online about the procedure and people have said it's uncomfortable at the least and very painful at the worst. A technician has to put a dildo-like ultrasound probe into my vagina against my cervix and move it around for about 45 minutes to locate my ovaries. 

I don't want a stranger to touch me like that and I'm panicking because the idea horrifies and disgusts me. In fact, in a ""would you rather"" scenario, I'd rather die than get this ultrasound. But that's not an option I'm only 21 I have a lot to live for and I just want to get through this and go back to living a life where I'm asymptomatic and happy (which I was until I found out about the ultrasound).

I haven't been able to go to work or school or eat or sleep since I found out I have to get this done (to see if I have an ovarian cyst that caused me to collapse in severe pain and nearly pass out). I've just been crying myself sick for hours on end. I know that when I get this ultrasound I will probably have flashbacks and intrusive memories and be in severe pain. I'm worried that I'll get so overwhelmed that I'll start to have suicidal thoughts. I have a therapy appointment in a week but I have to get the ultrasound and experience a lifetime of PTSD symptoms and emotional agony to get through before then.

I need advice and encouragement that I can get through this because I feel like I can't. And what do I tell the poor ultrasound technician that has to deal with me? I have no idea how to cope during the 45 minutes I'm being probed so if anyone has had this done and has advice for that I'd appreciate it."
I'm losing myself,"TW: CSA

I've known i was sexually abused by a stranger for a few years now, and I've learnt to cope with that.
But recently, memories have unrepressed of my mother molesting me and I honestly don't know how to cope anymore. 
I no longer feel human, I don't feel connected to myself, it's a long long story that I won't get into but I feel so disgusting that I can't eat and I'm scared to sleep. I miss feeling like myself, but I don't know if it'll ever come back. 
I'm scared, I feel so alone and alienated, I just want to know someone out there gets it.
I want to feel human again."
"It doesn't matter how ""good"" the present is, when you can't stop living in the past.","I was out skiing earlier today and was having flashbacks about my traumas the entire time. It was really frustrating to not be able to enjoy an activity I would typically love because I was so caught up in the past. 

I've come to the conclusion that for as long as I struggle with trauma, I'll also be depressed, because I just can't feel happy while I'm dwelling on the past. 

This thought scares me; maybe it means I'll always be depressed. I can't foresee a future where I ever overcome, or even learn to cope with, my trauma.

I don't plan on hurting myself, but this is really just no way to live. I need help.

Thanks for reading. Sorry if it seemed like a rant."
Any advice for dealing with paperwork while experiencing ptsd? (TW: sexual assault),"I’ve missed appointments and put off paperwork that could help me a lot financially... Aside from PTSD I had a severe concussion after being sexually and physically assaulted in early 2019, the effects lasted 6 months and made me incapable of doing many regular life things including working regularly.  There are programs I could apply to that provide compensation for injuries as a result of a crime, I’m eligible and I already get my emdr therapy 70% covered by this, but whenever I think of doing more or calling places I get brain fog and feel dizzy and usually have a panic attack until I distract myself. 


It’s the same with my follow up appointment with a neurologist, and it took me months of putting it off to finally see my psychiatrist to renew my medication because the last time we had met, it was a few months after the assault and we spoke about it briefly. Nowadays, going back is a reminder of what happened that right now I can’t handle well, but I need to do a lot of it soon... Does anyone have suggestions or ideas? Thank you <3"
Is it possible to have very minor ptsd as a result of situations caused by social anxiety?,"First things first, I in no way intend to be disrespectful, or undermine the experiences of anyone with this post. I am really scared to post this because I’m preempting negative or hostile responses regardless of how supportive and nice this community seems, so please be considerate if you intend to comment. Also, I probably won’t look at the comments for a long time as a way to reduce the fear I’ll feel when reading them. So keep that in mind if you’re expecting a reply from me. 

I experience social anxiety a lot. And quite severely too. Even with medication and regular therapy it still affects my daily life to a great extent. 

For those of you not familiar, social anxiety disorder could be summarised as an intense, usually irrational fear of being judged by others. Yes, of course it makes oral presentations a NIGHTMARE, but it also affects how loud I play music when home alone, in the fear that neighbours will judge my (un-noteworthy) music taste. Or what brands I buy, in fear of the cashier judging me. Or what pictures I set as my lock screen in case someone else sees it. Basically, it’s a very irrational fear that I’m very aware of. Regardless, I have little control over it as it is essentially instinctual, as y’all probably understand. 

Every now and then something will happen in my life that causes me great stress. A mundane event that becomes worse when combined with my SAD. Usually this is some form of criticism. The symptoms I’ve found most prominent are the main symptoms of PTSD; increased anxiety/aggression, reliving the event when triggered, avoidance of things I once enjoyed because of the event, things somewhat related to the event triggering anxiety and stress, dreams and nightmares surrounding the event etc. I’ll provide a few examples of these affecting me below. Not all of my symptoms, because I’m writing on mobile and some of them are self explanatory. 

For example, I used to do low level volleyball. The training sessions were really difficult for me as, being a beginner, I feared how my team perceived my ability. It continued like this, and was particularly bad during one session. I can’t remember what happened, which is pretty standard for my stressful memories, but I know it didn’t appear severe otherwise others on my team would also remember. For weeks after, the topic of volleyball caused great stress to me. 

The thought of practicing or going to games caused panic attacks. When I thought of the event my core would seize up, heart rate would increase, limbs would start trembling, and sometimes my breathing would speed up or become sporadic. A bit like a mini panic attack, without all the symptoms or duration (these episodes lasted a few seconds, 10 at the most).  

I would avoid the topic of volleyball for weeks after, even stopping reading a book series that mentioned volleyball because it reminded me too much of the event. I would lose interest in volleyball, despite me actually really enjoying it. 

It’s been a few years, but thinking of this instance still causes some of these symptoms, to a lesser degree. I don’t think I’ve ever had nightmares about this specific situation, but similar events have had negative influences on my dreams in the past. 

I’ve provided examples of these symptoms in relation to /just one/ event, but keep in mind this still occurs for all of my most stressful experiences which are numerous. 

Idk. I just feel kinda bad posting this here, because there are people with legitimately debilitating symptoms from horrible experiences and I’m curious about my problems, which are comparably laughable. And I’m worried I’m doing this ‘for attention’ or to be ‘special’, which I’m not. I just can’t help worrying about how others will see this post, and whether I can even trust my own motives. Anyway, thanks for your time. I don’t have anyone else I can talk to, so this is helpful."
I can’t figure out if I experienced trauma or anything else that would have caused my current issues as a child.,"EDIT because I forgot to put it in the title: light trigger warning for inc-st

First off, sorry if this isn’t the right place to post this. 

Anyway, I have pretty bad OCD, depression, and aspergers. My OCD has made me miserable my whole life because of my intrusive thoughts and compulsions and everything it doesn’t let me do. I’ve recently noticed, though, that the majority of my intrusive thoughts can be traced back to experiences in my childhood. I have awful thoughts of inc-st and I’ve always been driven to panic attacks at the thought of having sex with men and I even used to have meltdowns every time I saw underwear in stores (I’ve gotten better now luckily). Many sexual topics have always triggered me greatly. 

Tons of my intrusive thoughts center around my father. Whenever he calls me “honey” or any other names like that (can’t even type them because of how upset they make me) I panic and tense up and lose my mind for a while. One time he said he loved me and I dry heaved for about an hour. I like my dad and we don’t have a bad relationship but whenever he tries to talk to me on a personal level I have a panic attack. 

I can’t think of anything that’s objectively bad enough to be called actual trauma, but I know that how he treated me as a kid has contributed to these thoughts and reactions. He used to spank me and force me to take my pants and underwear down and he made me kiss him on the lips. My heart races and I’m brought near to tears when I hear his footsteps coming toward my room and idk why. I can’t pull up any more specific memories but when I think about my dad from when I was a kid I get upset. He’s on medication now but he used to be bad, he’s stayed up through the night with a gun on him, on our porch because he thought someone was coming to murder us. I don’t know his specific diagnosis but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was paranoid schizophrenia. He’s doing very well now, like I said, but it was not good when I was growing up. Before he got meds he abused alcohol and when he lost his job he just slept on the couch for 7 months. I think I’m rambling now. 

Anyway. Is this something that could cause the mental issues that I have today? I’ve been getting worse and worse and worse lately, just in the past few months. I don’t know what to do. I have a therapist but I don’t know what to talk to her about. I’m not good at talking to people in real life."
How to talk to my boss about PTSD affecting my work?,"Hey folks, need a little assistance and thought you’d be best to help. 

Has anyone here talked with their boss about their PTSD if it’s affecting you at work? The past couple weeks have been really rough and I’m concerned I’m on the hot seat. How should I explain it to him to help him be empathetic? My boss is a pretty pleasant person and I’m not concerned on telling him, just moreso on how I should tell him. Thank you in advance!"
PTSD from an accident at I wasn’t involved in?,"Last year around Christmas time my boyfriend got into a terrible motorcycle accident. He is okay and healing just fine but I still get upset just thinking about it.
When I go to work everyday I pass the part of the highway it happened on and I get very sad/angry/anxious. Some days are worse than others. I’m well aware that this wasn’t my accident but I can’t seem to figure out why it bothers me so much. I constantly replay that whole entire night in my head. I remember everything as if it happened yesterday. 
I can’t seem to shake this feeling of being so upset."
It's been nearly a year since I last worked.,"So I haven't worked in nearly a year, largely due to complications from anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I was hospitalized twice after attempting suicide because I couldn't handle the panic attacks anymore. I was starting to become a problem at work, too, just cause I was constantly terrified and didn't know how to keep it in. I've been pretty much entirely financially dependent on my parents and my best friends since then, and I've been really self-conscious about it despite my family's assurance that things were set up this way for my safety and it was OK. I've... had to deal with a lot of violence in the last several years. Rape, assault, abuse, suicide attempts. And I've really only started to move past it and learn to thrive in the last half a year or so with my friends, but I'm still all too aware that this isn't sustainable. My mom called me recently and told me that I needed to either get a job soon or go on disability for the sake of our family's finances. I'll gladly do it for that reason alone, and I've also *really* missed having money, but work is just scary to think about considering it helped put me in a mental hospital on multiple occasions. In that sense going to work kinda feels like playing Russian roulette, if I'm honest. It's mostly just humiliating to think that my illness has made me this dependent, and that my family have had to stretch themselves this thin just to help me. They know why I'm scared and that in a perfect world I'd be able to process this stuff on my own terms. But... I've just become too expensive, and at 23 years old that really hurts to think about.

Sometimes I wonder what kind of person I would be if I hadn't been raped, or hadn't been groomed as a teenager, or assaulted even younger than that. Would I have learned to stand on my own two feet by now? Would I need this much help to get there? I know I'll be OK in the end, but... I still just wish I wasn't so high-maintenace. I hate it. It feels like my fault. How do I stop being so needy? There's just... this really angry voice inside me yelling that I've sucked my family dry and all I have to show for it is self-pity. It hurts."
Referred to a different therapist,"Today I got trapped in a panic/ intrusive memory episode during therapy.  At the end she recommended I go to a therapist that does EMDR instead because traditional therapy is proving to be too triggering.

I know that is the right answer, but I feel like it is code for me being too weak and feeling rejected. Can someone voice of reason me?"
Uncomfortable/bad feeling around certain people? (TW: assault),"Does anyone get the thing where your brain almost gets stuck thinking a certain person will hurt you? 

I was assaulted when I was 15 by a very close friend, and I just can't stop thinking People I know are going to hurt me. It makes me want to cry because it's always nice people and I don't want to feel like that about them.

How do I stop feeling like this?"

Extreme flight response,I spend most of my time driving or walking in circles. I think trying to escape my mind. Almost everything else is painful. Does anyone else do this?
motivation issues,Since I got PTSD I have had issues having the energy to work at something.  I just don't feel the energy to do anything productive with myself.  Does anyone else feel like this?
PTSD and working,"I recently have gone back to work after a little me time. I found a good job, very low pay, and I figured ""some extra cash is good"". I told them my max hours to be worked was 32 since I plan on going back to school next semester. It's my second week, coming up on my third. Just got my schedule for next week, and after increasing week after week, they've gone over the 32 hours, and have me working 9-6. I applaud those who can do 9-6 office, I personally can't. It makes me dread being there, especially when I applied for a position that would be working with people and now I'm sitting behind a desk. 

PTSD gives me A LOT of anxiety, self doubt, negative thoughts in general. And I've been working through them with this job. But after seeing this new schedule I'm almost in tears because I know this has to be confronted and I've never been good with that. I'm very reliable, and have been taken advantage by employees for it before, and I'm still working on setting hard boundaries. How should I go about this?"

(TW) what would this be considered?,"(Trigger Warning) recently entered a PHP program (partial hospital) I have quite a few mental health issues among other environmental problems. 
After my intake/evaluation I was placed in trauma track for ptsd and some red flags.
I’m enjoying the program so far and it’s helping but I’m unsure about some of what I’ve been through I flip and flop and feel embarrassed and guilty over the situation that has traumatized me not being serious or big enough . I don’t want to insult other people’s real issues . I expressed my feelings to a counselor and they said I’m having trouble with “radical acceptance” I really just need an outside honest opinion on my story.

I was in a toxic relationship in high school my junior year his senior year. He could definitely be considered emotionally abusive , manipulative and favored gaslighting . 
I can’t quiet remember very big details of the day it happened only a year ago did I even remember what happened after repressing it for 4 years.  I was triggered when my friend and I were talking about the past and he had mentioned what my ex used to say about me after we broke up. The main one “yeah she took my virginity it wasn’t even good” and then a lot of it just flooded back I became teary eyed and frustrated cuz he didn’t elaborate the fact that I lost my virginity too and I didn’t want it to happen.
The day of him and I planned to have sex condom , no clothes ect.  But when he actually started to penetrate me it was too painful and I said it hurt and I wanted it to stop. He got upset and said “if you can’t do it now what makes you think you’ll ever be able to do it” I didn’t want him to be upset I didn’t respond. He told me to get on top of him and said “go at your own pace” so I complied still not saying anything.  It was reverse cow girl I did not want to face him now. I don’t remember if I had started crying yet. 
But my “pace” wasn’t fast enough and he grabbed my hips pushed them down on top of him essentially forcing it in.  I was crying now I don’t think I physically did much I remember looking back and seeing how disappointed and miserable he was. He tried to get me to bounce or move but ultimately gave up.  There was a lot of blood I knew there would be some but seeing it almost sent me into a shock. He just got annoyed with my being upset and flushed the condom. I don’t remember anything after that.
We dated for more months after that about 2 and according to old messages everything was fine. I told him I was still in pain but I did it flirtatiously so it wouldn’t count."
Night Terrors: My subconscious going into battle.,"To be quite honest, I believed the doctors who told me I would grow out of the night terrors at age 10, that it was a puberty thing. I experienced severe trauma during my childhood, but I thought I was normal. I had successfully hidden my traumas as a 10 year old, and even into my late teen years. Then I cracked. After almost 20 years of being abused, being in a burn accident, and the guilt that comes with it, I am no longer good at hiding my traumas. I was diagnosed with PTSD three years ago. I still have night terrors that could be a scene from a scary movie and viewers would actually be terrified, I know my SO is. I feel I can’t talk with anyone, even my psychiatrist, because no one understands how they feel unless you have had them. This extreme terror. Heart Beating. Hyperventilating, screaming bloody murder, reliving the worst moments of your life. I feel like my subconscious is locked in a never ending battle with my past. If this happens to you, please know that I’m sorry but I would love to hear any of your experiences of things that helped or didn’t, if you’re willing to share."

Sex Education is a very well written Americanised teen comedy. In The UK, many wonder at the highly unrepresentative student demographic for a supposedly impossible Rural School. Even the school lockers and clothing has been Americanised. Also, Sorry to break some folks dreams but Military Academies are very US but very Un-UK. EDIT - One storyline using Statutory Rape as a theatrical device is plain silly. The term has no place in British  Law. There now will be a growing cadre of millions of confused UK kids believing it does. 

However, the Aimee Lou Wood storyline is very well written and uses so many camera and directorial tricks to communicate fleeting reality to the audience. This also leaves screen peers with credible confusion and misunderstanding. It's well worth watching so as to be able to see and if appropriate learn the signs, signals and distress of a teen girl's PTSD linked to sexual assault. 

That the storyline is embedded in an angst-ridden teen comedy with adult themes on sex makes it more credible and gives real and valid contrast with depth and reality."
Overwhelmed with anger,⭐️
Revisiting,"I'm making this post at the suggestion of my therapist. I met with her today and she pointed out when I talked about this community I was bright, hopeful, and optimistic. This was in relation to the shame I felt about the last time I posted, in which I was too open and admitted to things that made me feel ashamed of myself. As a result, I felt disgusted with myself and people as a whole and swore off this subreddit.

I'm back though because of a challenge she proposed to help me overcome my self-inflicted sense of shame. My trauma is sexually based. Over my healing process I've slowly developed a healthier sex drive and mindset about sex. Today's session was extremely uncomfortable because I admitted something to my therapist that I didn't want to, but something which I knew would be a constant distraction to me if I didn't say anything.

I had a wet dream about my therapist.

I was sexually abused almost exactly one year ago. Since then, I've had sexually-oriented dreams that were weird and painful and mostly ended up in me waking up in physical pain. I haven't had a physically pleasurable wet dream until recently. The dream was (obviously) sexual in nature and my sexual partner in my dream was my therapist. I was engaged to a woman I loved in the past and I loved her, she loved me but for whatever reason she broke the engagement off. Since then, the only woman I've trusted and felt safe around was my therapist.

The dream I had about my therapist and us together was the most sexually satisfied I've ever felt, even including being with my fiancee.

I told my therapist this and I feel so screwed up sharing this with others and I'm only doing so because she listened to me describe the dream and encouraged me to post here because it's been a safe place in the past"
Does anybody else have an anchoring object?,"I feel really stupid and childish for this but it really helps and I want to know if anyone else does the same... I still have this colourful little elephant from my childhood. I got it when I was born. I was attached to it throughout my childhood and treated it like a real person up until high school. When I used to have nightmares, I would rub my thumb over the tip of his trunk and hold him close. 

My trauma occured in high school. I'm so thankful that my elephant doesn't cause memories and feelings related to that. It just reminds me of a little girl who was happy and healthy, loving and calm and didn't see any bad in the world except for in her nightmares of aliens and robbers! The tip of his trunk is rough now from all the times I used to run my fingers over it. It reminds me that I am safe and calm and okay. 

More often than not I wake up with nightmares, or flashbacks related to my trauma. It feels like it's happening all over again and sometimes it can take an hour or more to calm down. I've started keeping my elephant next to my pillow so I see him when I'm having flashbacks. I hold him close and fight off the feelings and anchor myself to the now - that I'm in bed with soft sheets and warm blankets and my little elephant that I've had since I was a baby. It helps me to bring myself out of the bad memories I have. 

I feel ridiculous for being a grown adult who clings to a stuffed toy like a young child! Sometimes I just wish I was that child again, because everything seems so painful now. Does anybody else use something like this?"
Is it possible to have PTSD from a war you never fought?,"Hey, everyone. So I’ll cut straight to the point: I did an in-depth study of WWI, including analysis of photographs, diaries, letters, the works. And now, thanks to an overactive imagination aiding the fleshing out of the human side of the war (specifically the Somme), I’m experiencing phenomena that seem to be related to post-traumatic stress. Certain things (fireworks, gunshots, and other sudden, loud noises) are mildly unsettling in good days, and utterly terrifying on bad days. Sometimes, when I’m alone and everything is quiet, I swear I can hear artillery. It’s not as bad as it was, and I’ve gone to a therapist about it, but it sometimes gets to the point that it’s debilitating. I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this? I want to stress: I’m not military in any way; I am very thoroughly a civilian, and have nothing but the utmost respect for the military. This just seemed like the place to ask about this."
Had the best first date.,"So why did i cry the entire hour home? Im not sure, its been years since my wife passed away, I'm not sure i can let her go enough to give another woman a shot. I've gone on more than a dozen dates in the past few months, but never wanted to cry afterwards."
PTSD Associated With Binge Eating Symptoms in Men and Women,">Subthreshold and threshold post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are associated with binge eating symptoms in both men and women, according to a study published in The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry.

>Among men who witnessed trauma, combat-related trauma was linked with fewer binge eating symptoms, the study found. Conversely, among women who witnessed trauma, child maltreatment was associated with more binge eating symptoms.

I wont get into all of them because there's certain people who know about my account that I'd rather not have know specifics. One of the most traumatic things was the suicide of a best friend online a few months back. 

I'm part of the reason for their death and that eats at me every moment of my life. I get flashbacks to our conversations, so many simple things trigger outbursts that it's just getting debilitating sometimes. I just cant escape that moment, I've self harmed a lot in the past and recent, but even that triggers it sometimes. I feel just trapped, like I'm constantly terrified of the what ifs to the point where entire days are spent in states of panic and despair. What if one of my friends harms, what if my girlfriend harms again, what if I cant stop them, what if I loss someone else. I dont think I could manage losing another one, I have so much guilt and fear from the last time, another would push me over the edge.

I also had a previous obsession with a girl I knew. She never cared for me at all and that drove me mad. For clarification I never stalked her or made creepy advances towards her or anything. I just felt a connection with her that I have only had with one other person in my life. 

My family doesnt know because I doubt they'd ever believe me and say I just have some form of depression. I do have depression but this isnt like that, this feels.... deeper. Like a pit I keep sinking into, a downwards spiral that I cant escape from. The only thing I look forward to is getting to see the love of my life in person come Autumn. But I'm convinced that wont end up happening, that she'll die before that, she'll resent me before that and wont want anything to do with me, or that we'll just drift away and lose interest, rather she'll lose interest in me. Shes one of the best things I have in my life and it would wreck me to have her leave too like a lot of others did.

I'm rambling now, I'll just stop here I'm getting annoyed at myself for talking.

Anyways yeah, that's a bit of what I wanted to say."
“You don’t smile like you used to” [TW: Attempted murder/violence mention],"When I was very young, I was known as one of the happiest kids ever. I would be incredibly bright about whatever I wanted to talk about. I was very oblivious, but I was happy. That all changed when I was 9.
It seemed like it’d be a normal day in my life, but instead, I had a traumatic event. I was 9 years old when I was nearly murdered at 4 in the morning. Some teen that we didn’t know existed at the time broke into our home, walked upstairs into my room, and tried to kill me for reasons I still don’t know a decade later. I very nearly died.

At first soon after I managed to survive, I thought everything would be fine and back to normal, but I was wrong. A year later, I was diagnosed with PTSD. I became fearful of the world around me, I got several triggers, and I also developed depression. I still have the scars on my neck to prove it.

A common thing I hear from family and friends of family is “you don’t smile like you used to”, and it’s true. I can have my giggly moments, but I rarely smile anymore. Being degraded and disregarded for your mental illness for years will do that to you.

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been told I’m strong, and those same people will act surprised when I have a PTSD moment. It does mean a lot when someone calls me strong, but not when I’ll be disregarded. It’s like their definition of strength is not showing weaknesses.

I’ve had several traumatic events happen since, mainly due to being abused or bullied, but I’m still here. I’m still fighting my demons, and I’ll likely fight them for the rest of my life, but that doesn’t mean I won’t be able to enjoy living. I know I don’t physically smile a lot, my mind can be happy. I hope I can learn to find happiness, and I hope the same thing for everyone else who has PTSD. I know I’ve said things like this a lot to other people, but I still mean every word. Sometimes I have to tell myself these things. Life isn’t easy, but I’ll keep trying."
dissociation,"i’m 15(f) and i was diagnosed about a year ago. i haven’t really experienced any symptoms besides sudden flashbacks every now and then and nightmares. i knew it should be worse bc what happened me was pretty sucky. i was scared for when everything finally hit me and i think it is now. i constantly feel like my brain is far away from my body and i can’t communicate with it. i find myself having to “act” like myself and do and say things i usually would do or say to mask this. is this dissociation? it’s so horrible and confusing. i have been really agitated, i just get so angry so easily and i used to be very timid. i feel like a different person. the weird this is i can’t really think about the trauma. every time i try it feels like my brain goes around it. it’s very complicated and wanted to know if anyone felt like this too?"
I don’t feel here anymore and I don’t know who I am.,"I was diagnosed with ptsd I think three years ago. I lost track of numbers. I think I’ve posted here once before, i can’t remember. I’ve lost track of my life and I’ve lost track of everything. Like, I don’t know how to explain it but everything seems like a dream (or a nightmare). I don’t feel like I’m me. Like I don’t feel like I’m in my body. I don’t know, this is hard to explain. I’m so sorry. 

But for example, apparently today I wrote my biology exam. I don’t remember any bit of it. Only way I know about it is because my friend in the class messaged me about an hour ago asking how I thought I did. I could understand if it was a quiz, but it was an exam. I sat in a classroom for three hours (or two, I’m not sure. I think exams are three hours at my school but I honestly don’t know anymore) writing and I can’t recall a moment of it. 

And I was in the kitchen a few moments ago and I looked at the photos on the fridge and there’s a photo of me when I was younger, but I don’t recognize it as me. I know it’s me, but like. I don’t know. I’m so sorry I suck at explaining this. Really.

I know disassociating can happen and can be severe and I just. I don’t even know. Can anybody tell me what’s going on?"
Does time heal it?,"You ppl that have had ptsd for longer than 3+ years, has the symptoms reduced anything? Are you on meds? Or work out in addition to that? Overall What do you guys feel really helped you come back to a stable self.

Edit: spelling mistakes"
Repressed memory embarrassment,"I was diagnostic with PTSD while a sophomore in high-school, went through 4 years of therapy for a bunch of issues. The main one being PTSD,  so I used to pride my self in my coping skills, until recently. 
Context: I was abused from before I started school until the end of 5th grade in just about every way by my “step dad” at the time. 
I’m now in my mid 20’s and something set off a repressed memory and I now realize I was groomed as a young child. 
I now have no idea how to handle my self, and I’m too embarrassed to tell anyone in my life. 
I’m sure my husband can tell somethings wrong, getting quiet and having more night terrors and sleep paralysis. 
But I’m too embarrassed to open up to him about it since I never went into detail with him before, but it’s pretty much assumed. 
I’m afraid to open up about it because it might just spiral, but I’m also afraid to not say anything just in case I let it bubble and pop. 
Any advice?"
Return to work after career damaged by PTSD (potential TW),"Hi all, 

Figure I'll start with a bit of background, and go into my query from there. 

Two years ago, I was diagnosed with PTSD due to my employment. My work involved animals, and my condition evolved from the conflict between my duties and my own sense of personal ethics and morals. Over time, I entered into deeper and deeper cycles of depressions, anxiety and associated factors such as suicidal ideation and auditory sensitivity. 

Then, BAM, I fell into full blown PTSD (hyper-vigilance, nightmares, memory recall, the lot). At the time it happened I was terrified and had no idea what was happening. After a visit to my second  psychologist (the first was terrible), I was formally diagnosed with PTSD under the DSM-5 criteria. This diagnosis was later confirmed by a psychiatrist and a psychologist assigned to my worker's compensation case. 

Due to the condition, and the associated horrors which go along with it, I had no choice but to leave my job entirely. My primary duties were obviously major triggers for me, and even associated tasks (such as administration duties) became significantly troubling. 

I'm on the path to recovery using a combination of CBT and EMDR to deal with symptoms and the root source of my PTSD, and I'm showing signs of progress. I'm still ups and downs, but I'm generally feeling good enough to start being a functioning member of society again (or so I think). In saying that, I've no idea how.

My old career, which I had spent twelve years building is gone. Education, training, experience, all of it. Alternate employment within my field (conservation, biology and zoology) is not an option, as it would involve interaction with equipment and environments which act as major triggers for me. 

So, a complete career change it has to be. I have enough skills in administration and data management to cope, and people skills to boot (including presentation experience). However, no matter what I do I feel like a fraud. I feel like I'm not good enough or skilled enough to gain employment in any other field but what I've known. Hell, half the time I barely even feel human.

I'm also terrified of returning to work in case it hurts me again (as my former position has). 

So, here's my question. For those of you who've managed a career switch (or just re-employment) after suffering from PTSD, how did you do it? Did you go out and completely re-train? Or did you simply re-organise your existing skill-set and apply for roles which were significantly different from your old ones? And, once you started working again, did it help you feel more human? Or was it just added strain on top of your recovery? 

I'm really interested to know, and would like to hear from you. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Spent twelve years working a career which led to the development of PTSD. Education, training and experience are all but useless now as any closely associated career would likely act as a trigger. Currently in recovery, and looking at part-time work to make myself feel more human. 

Wondering how other PTSD survivors came back from their condition to find employment, how they did it, and if it helped them.

Edit: I'm not sure, but I think I may be getting downvoted? (either that, or reddit is having some counting issues today). 

I know this is a new account, but I made it because this is highly personal and important to me, and my primary account is very much not. I'm genuinely looking for answers and guidance, and would really appreciate any help this community might give me on this step in recovery.

Also, one final question. How do you get over your own/society's expectations of having to go back to work if you haven't?"
I think I might have PTSD,"First, I  want to say that I do not intend to come across as disrespectful to anyone; if I do, I truly am sorry. Something very traumatic happened to me when I was 16 and it just clicked in my mind that I am not over that series of events. I really don’t know if I should go into detail, it’s not necessarily my story to tell. However, I was sort of a “bodyguard” for my best friend who decided to become a prostitute at the time. I know...it is crazy. It’s just, there were too many times where I walked into a situation believeing someone will not walk out alive. I was already diagnosed with MDD before this whole situation. Afterwards, I experienced a level of depression and fear that overcome and demolished my life. Dropped out of school, stopped eating, became a complete recluse, there is just too much to list. I still feel these effects to this day. Can anyone give me some insight on...anything?"
Do your symptoms fluctuate?,"I go through periods where I feel ok. I feel like I'm finally moving on. The flashbacks and anxiety fade. Then I go through periods where it all starts creeping back. Sometimes it's triggered by something, other times no reason at all."
I don't want to go back to normality,"I've done a lot of high-intensity activism over the past year. Lots of criminal charges and experiences/witnessing of physical violence against nonviolent protesters. Less than 3 weeks ago I went up against riot police. There's been interpersonal conflict/fallout amongst organizers of the action since then, and I'm finding I don't have the emotional capacity to deal with it at all.

I don't feel like I deserve to live. I've lost faith both my own ideology/worldview and in my prospects for being accepted by and working well with the people I've spent the last year repeatedly putting my body on the line alongside. (It's not that I disagree with them/myself on political points so much as that I don't know what I believe or where I fit in when it comes to various subtle but emotionally-charged debates.) So I'm disconnected from the only people who would get it, but I'm also disconnected from the people who've never done anything like this.

I can't imagine ever doing anything that would feel like ""enough"". I can't unsee the stuff we were protesting, or unknow what I know about the horrible oppression and trauma that many of the people I've met in this desperate line of action have experienced, often for many years if not their whole lives. And I can't ignore the ecological collapse the world's experiencing, which leaves me with no hope for any sort of medium or long-term improvement in any aspect of society, just mass death ahead.

I've been having a lot of self-harm and suicide ideation. The latter isn't stuff I'd act on, though the arguments for it are convincing to me, but the former is concerningly realistic--stuff I could very easily do. I'm also bingeing on everything I binge on, and avoiding interpersonal communication including to some extent around stuff I'm committed to. I know I need to change how I'm thinking so I feel better, but I'm hitting this roadblock because I don't *want* to.

I feel too alienated from the normal, privileged lifestyle I'm living to want to be in it. And I feel too alienated from... whatever it was I was trying to do with organizing to even know how to conceptualize going back to that. Somehow it's overwhelmingly painful that things are okay for me and that I'm an individual with my own life and not having my identity temporarily merged with comrades in a high-intensity struggle. I don't know what it was about the last month or two compared to the rest of my time organizing, but for the first time I don't know who I am or how to go on after everything that's happened.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? How do I go back to normal life when I don't want to and can't imagine it?"
"When there is no before, what lies ahead?","I see so many people talk about healing like it's a goal of being as close to they were ""before"" as they can get.
But what about those of us who have no before? 
The first time I was...the first incident started when I was three. 

Healing is a journey but I can't see the road. What good is a map that can only show you one place to be?"
I'm tired of smiling all the time,"I know this is a minor inconvenience compared to all of the other PTSD symptoms, but still. Sometimes people tell me they love how my smile brightens up the room, and inside I just feel like a fraud because more often than not I'm just smiling out of fear."
My boyfriend says my rape wasn't traumatizing,"My boyfriend has deployed twice. I was raped by my partner (at the time, not my current boyfriend,) kept the baby and tried to stay until the police came one too many times and threatened to call CPS if I didn't remove my child from his house ASAP. SD wasn't involved and eventually died. His family has used the court system to harass me for years since. Anyway, I was upset and talking to my boyfriend about it and he said I chose this. I didn't choose to be raped. I chose to keep my child and do what I thought was the right thing. I didn't choose the life sentence of harassment and abuse from my ex and his family ever since. My boyfriend constantly tells me to suck it up because ""at least I've never been to war."" This makes me feel like he is a true sociopath and I should block his number and never look back. Someone please tell me I'm not crazy for thinking that my PTSD is just as significant as his."
Where to turn?,"I feel at a loss for what to do next. I'm a freshman in college, and I've had PTSD for the vast majority of my life. I'm on a downward spiral, and I feel incredibly isolated and alone. I have a therapist and a psychiatrist, but I don't feel like I'm making that much progress.

I'm struggling to get to my classes, eat, shower, etc. I don't know where to turn next. I don't have a lot of friends to lean on (or any close friends) as I have major trust issues, and I came here with major trust issues.

Has anyone felt so confused about where to go? I'm accepting that I can't do this alone, but I don't really have anyone irl that I can go to for support."
I hate this,"I can't seem to have a normal relationship with anyone. I keep everyone at a distance, even loved ones. I feel all alone...all the time. I sit in my house struggling just to get through the day. This is not living. My past is sad and tragic, but why does it have to effect me this much. Why can't I just get over everything? I would give anything to not feel this way."
PTSD is ruining lifes,"I only have one life. So I don’t waste it on the past.
I have my past holding me back today, it’s traumatic memorie blocked in my brain, I consider this more as a physical symptom than depression or mood problems.

Yes I feel totally lost and deep down,
But no I don’t give up and keep surfing on life.

And of course I see a therapist to help me to surpass this problem.

You can’t waste 10 years of life by saying « it’s ptSd » 
But you can say :
Since my trauma I feel bad. I will work to get through it. Not giving up...

 That’s the culture of hope I think.."
Dating life sucks,"Before i got ptsd i was a very forward guy, i never had trouble talking to people, i was very extrovert, going on dates felt like nothing. Now i have become very introvert, social interaction feel like I’m having an intensive workout in my brain, I have major anxiety issues too. I don’t even dear to go on dates with  people, I overthink every situation and I just hate how my life has really done an 180 on me. It just feel like ptsd really took all my good parts and made them shit."
My therapist thinks I should try an anti-depressant.,"I was just wondering what everyone else's experiences were. I'm kind of worried about side-effects. What he said was I should try Effexor specifically because he said I have anxiety and depression symptoms and it can treat both. I'd never heard of it and there doesn't seem to be a ton of publicly available research on it, or about PTSD being treated with SSRIs or SNRIs in general. Could it help with my daytime sleepiness, or should I try talking to a sleep specialist about Modafinil for that instead?"
Today I was deadnamed in front of every single patient at my treatment facility. The flashbacks came and I uncovered 3 repressed memories. I sobbed for an hour and a half and threw 3 chairs and slammed the front dolr in front of everyone.,
Where does your hope come from?,"I’ve had PTSD for close to a year now, I’ve been in therapy for months. When it’s 5am and I still can’t sleep everything I’ve been working on feels completely useless. This sub is great for feeling less alone, but all I ever really see is people in just as dark of a place as I am. Did any of you get better? What helped you through the worst of it? What did progress look like? Is it going to be worth all of the time and money I’ve spent trying to live a normal life again? What keeps you going when you’d kill for an hour of sleep?"
Prolonged trigger experience,"So halfway through group session yesterday they added a new patient who manages to hit a number of my triggers.  It's been like 18 hours and I am still extremely worked up.  My intrusive memories are worse and i am shaking.

Today is my last session and I am terrified to go, but also pretty certain I am not better enough for the real world if I am so damn spun out over one random person who didnt do anything wrong but just happens to tick a lot of the boxes that makes my brain scream ""danger.""

I dunno.  Disappointed and terrified."
Help? Advice needed.,"So
I have had issues since a young age but ill summarise. 

Sexually abused as a child, by someone of the same age and gender as me but obviously more to it like i reckon she was getting abused etc etc else how would she have known certain things to do etc.
From about 10 onwards been under Camhs who diagnosed me with panic attacks and anxiety.
I.rarely attended school, had to sit at the back of the class else i was TERRRRIBLY anxious, shaky and fidgety etc and just walked out crying. 
Everyone put  it down to anxiety and panic attacks.
Then
Last January my doctor finally felt i should see  a psychiatrist- who diagnosed me with Bipolar and Panic attacks/anxiety.
I get months where im on a high, rarely panic attacks, not anxious, just living life,sexually active, shopping etc...then months of sadness anxiety cant even do things like walk down the road..i look a mess, just have 0 energy and go into a bit of a slump. 
Im on carbamazepine and sertraline.

I have so many worries and doubts like is it bipolar? Is it something more? Because im fine recently like my moods been good just randomly hormonal etc though, not even due on a period but just up and down a bit. Then today i go into a shop, come over all faint..dizzy...sweaty...light headed cant even speak properly and just need to get out asap. 
My eyes get all wide and just vacant and i feel like a zombie.
Is this normal with bipolar? Like why are my physical effects so bad!? Doctors just put it down to stress but i just wondered if anyone else has experienced the same thing as i am going out of my mind here."
Who else became really good at seducing men as a way to control them in order to survive?,"Who else became really good at seducing men as a way to control them in order to survive?

I was sexualized starting as a child from my father through mostly covert sexual abuse. The way I survived was by seducing and flirting with him. My mom was out to get me and the way I learner to receive love was by seducing. It became a way for me to get control in an unsafe situation. If I got the man to develop a crush on me, distract them and become infatuated, I was more able to control them so I was safe. I notice this pattern will come out especially around unsafe and angry men. I’ve done this technique when I felt I was being discriminated against, too. It gets the men to let their guard down, be nicer to me and get what I want because to them I am flattering their ego and playing submissive. Obviously this is maladaptive coping mechanism that I am unlearning. But yeah I realized recently it has helped me survive racism and sexism And to avoid others’ aggression. I also realized I liked how it kept me safe and gave me power in an unsafe situation. It gave me power over my abusers and I was able to punish men by seducing them and rejecting them and keeping myself safe. 
Sometimes I think about about becoming a stripper because I am really good at seducing and making myself Into a man’s “dream girl.”

Who else relates?"
"Communities and PTSD: Northern Ireland, ""The horrifying statistics that lie behind our mental health crisis""",">More people have died by suicide in Northern Ireland than those who died as a result of The Troubles. In 2018 it was revealed that since the peace deal in 1998 there have been 4,500 registered suicides in Northern Ireland, compared to the 3,525 lives lost during the conflict. In 2018 there were 308 deaths by suicide in Northern Ireland, 228 of them were men. In 2017 the rate of suicide in Northern Ireland stood at 18.5 per 100,000 people. This rate is double that recorded in England (9.2 per 100,000 people) in the same year. 
>
>....
>
>This high suicide rate may also be linked to prevalence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in Northern Ireland as a result of the conflict. In 2019, the Irish Times estimated that 39 percent of the population had witnessed an experience or traumatic event linked directly to the conflict which could potentially contribute to a diagnosis of PTSD. 
>
>[Impartial Reporter](https://www.impartialreporter.com/news/18173654.victoria-johnston-horrifying-statistics-lie-behind-mental-health-crisis/)

That 39% is an improvement on 20 years ago. Then the figure was 50%+. It was inline with places like Kosovo, Bosnia and other civil war zones.

The reduction in 20 years is not due to treatment but simple demographic changes that occur when people die and are replaced by a younger generation. It is estimated that it will take another 2 generations (40 to 50 years) ore PTSD in Ulster drops to a normal population level. 

When you look at the number of people in Ulster - some 800,000 people are still dealing with PTSD. That's more than twice the whole of the UK armed forces... and some wonder at why I get pissed at the Military = Valid PTSD stupidity that is still being peddled."
Exposing my abuser,"I went to the cops like seven years ago to tell them about my uncle molesting me.
That was useless.
It made me give up.
Family is sweeping it under the carpet.
I moved 2000km away from home and my sister came to visit around the same time frame.
She had me crying as she was accusing me of making it up and telling me how uncomfortable I was making it for everyone.almost like she wanted me to say I made it up. She has three kids and will gladly take them to my uncles for Christmas, although she and my bro in law claims she will never leave her kids with him.....
But fuck her and her gaslighting. Anyways 
I’m getting more memories of abuse, and having clearer memories today.
And I finally decided....
I’m going to make my family suffer with me...the family that sweeps it under the rug. I’m going to speak the truth.
I shouldn’t be the only one who’s uncomfortable.
But I’m not talking spite here folks. I’m asking for a clear and actionable game plan folks so...

* went to the police it was useless
* family other than my parents don’t believe me fuck them
*so I got ahold do my old youth pastor who’s the head of a major bible college, my abuser goes to his and my old church and I’m hoping something will get done. He took my number down and says he is going to follow up. I hope he can get him banned from doing stuff with kids at church activities, he also coaches hockey stuff for teens so...
* I called social services back home and told them my story and they’re going to start an investigation 

What else fam? No way I’m going vigilante unless literally ALL options have been exhausted (and that means I can always tell one more person, I’m done being discouraged I’ll keep yapping until something happens)
I know I’m not going to get justice but people need to know he is a danger around children"
Cyberbullying Linked to Increased Depression and PTSD,">Cyberbullying had the impact of amplifying symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder in young people who were inpatients at an adolescent psychiatric hospital, according to a new study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. The study addressed both the prevalence and factors related to cyberbullying in adolescent inpatients.

"Are these PTSD symptoms, or something else? (TW: description of symptoms)","Hi, I'm undiagnosed with anything but I just wanted to see if anybody related. 

I don't experience constant hyperarousal that many people seem to. I do have flashbacks almost daily, and OSDD-like symptoms (again, undiagnosed, but they're similar.)

The flashbacks tend to last between a minute and thirty minutes, and leave me on edge for an hour up to a few hours afterwards, and there's a couple of different events I flashback to. 

I feel disgusted and extremely on edge/uncomfortable around children, certain topics, phrases or situations trigger anxiety and flashbacks 

I'm just wondering, without the hyperarousal, are these still symptoms of PTSD?"
PTSD IS REAL,"I was diagnosed with PTSD a few years ago and have been going to therapy ever since. I’ve tried so many meds but honestly, I’m better without them. I don’t remember my trauma exactly, but I know what happened to me. Because of this, I have had too many people tell me my ptsd is not valid. It’s gotten to the point where I even bully myself out of my feelings. I can’t heal because every time I try to do something that’ll help my ptsd, I tell myself that it’s not real so I can’t fix it. I feel so alone and so over dramatic. I wish I could just let myself get better."
Remembering things,I have PTSD and I’m in school. A lot of my test and quizzes require me to memorize things. Ever since PTSD I struggle with this. It seems to be bringing my grades down. Does anybody have any tips to help memorize things or to manage this?
PTSD severity [questions],"I am new to this community and I am only recently accepting having this disorder. But I don't understand to what extent I have it. Here are some of my symptoms. 
•anytime I'm in public I fear my abuser is watching me
•most men remind me of him
•most cars remind of his car
•I feel the need to escape almost every public space I put myself in or I'm forced into
•I have severe nightmares revolving around the assaults 
•I have flashbacks were i curl up, shake, and get cold
•the touch of other people's hands, even my own make me feel disgusting again, and violated
•I flinch at affection 
•I purposefully trigger myself by looking back on his pictures because I feel like if I forget his face I'm in danger and he will attack me in public
•some nights I have dissociative seizures and I repeat phrases he used to say or I make the ""vroom vroom"" sound to his car and scream

Does this seem severe to anyone? Or like average ptsd? I'm very confused if I should be taking meds or continue with my talk therapy. I only see her once a week, sometimes once every other week, and I don't think its going enough."
My gf thinks I have ptsd...,Long story short I was a corrections officer/deputy for a state prison. Iv been in law enforcement my whole adult life I'm 25 now. Iv seen overdoses to fatal accidents and a infant hot car death. Iv been fighting all these feelings and hiding flashbacks nightmares and all the feelings of disgust and just hatred. I see that little girl everday and I see the victim of one of the accidents and I see my family in that place and it kills me. I dont talk to anyone anymore because it's so hard and exhausting to hide these feelings. The only reason I'm looking for help now is my gf is threating to leave me if I dont because I wake up screaming at night to having full on flash backs in the day. I'm not sure if its ptsd or me just not cut out for the line of work but I gotta do something any help would be amazing I should add that this has been ongoing for 2 years and only getting worse
Survivors of Murder-Suicide,"\*\*TRIGGER WARNING\*\*

&#x200B;

Hi all,

In 2018 I became a survivor of murder-suicide.

Facts were written in the media, case files, autopsy reports and death certificates. They were illustrated with crime scene photos and national news headlines.

Breadcrumbs of truth built the narrative for me, never telling the full story.

There are 11 murder-suicides each week in the United States, often in military and veteran communities. Why aren’t we talking about this publicly beyond sensationalized headlines that don’t help solve the problem?

The lack of support, information, and humanization led me to believe nobody *should* be talking about it. I felt voiceless and carried significant guilt and shame because of the stigmatized circumstances.

I’m taking back the narrative. As a survivor of murder-suicide, I am more than a murderer’s daughter.

My writing will add to the national conversation on mental health and veteran post-traumatic stress disorder. I hope my story will educate the public and help survivors of this type of tragedy to know they are not alone; the shame is not theirs to carry as they navigate their complex journey.

If you are a survivor of murder-suicide, or know somebody who is looking for support, connect with me here. I am connecting with researchers and fellow survivors to reduce the stigma on this awful experience, and help other survivors. I am committed to taking my experience and turning it into a force for good to help others."
Just PTSD ramblings about a shitty PTSD day,"TL;DR Met someone else with PTSD. Tried to help - feel like I really screwed up, feel like maybe I didn't.

Sorry if I ramble, I'm a bit shaken up. I was recently introduced to someone who also has PTSD. I was a bit reluctant to connect but decided to be cautiously optimistic as there aren't many ways to meet people here (besides bars) or any local PTSD peer/group resources in our area for civilians. Done all the one on one with counselors and need to connect in person with others who can relate. Knowing to be careful in any case, and not looking for dating (and making that clear to him), we met a only a few times and chatted about how to address PTSD symptoms in a healthy manner. Friendly and polite, encouraging his engagement with hobbies while having some laughs as we seemed to share the same type of humour. Just decent human stuff.

Fast forward to today. Another invitation but me declining as I'm sicker than a dog with fever and chills. Christ if I didn't suddenly get multiple messages about how he'd received bad news and was in the middle of a PTSD episode. On to how I grounded him and helped him think clearer and had hopes I'd find him attractive, etc. Then sharing how missed his army buddies who'd died and wanted to give up as life is too painful. Over and over again. I tried calling but he wouldn't pick up. Just more messages of the same nature. And more.

It's an unsettling position and my heart was going out to him. I used to have the same dark thoughts time to time. There was also more than one occasion as a kid where someone gouged their wrists open in front of me or I had to hold them down because they were trying to throw themselves in harms way.

Not knowing his family or anyone he might know, I looked up and called a vet line asking if they could help out. They instructed me contact the local RCMP. I did so, explaining the above and asking if they could just make sure he was okay.

They advised me to keep him engaged in conversation if I could while they sent someone over. Cut short our call when his doorbell rang. A few moments later, the RCMP called me back asking about his phone as it was going straight to voicemail and he had all his lights out and curtains drawn. All I could do was repeat the number. About 15 minutes later, a call back. He'd stated he was fine and downplayed his claims, citing counselors, medications, etc that he says he's accessing so they left.

In come a bunch of nasty messages. To the effect of ""if I really cared, I would have come over myself. He went on to state he'd been thrown around by members when having a bad day but he was just sad. That he has negative feelings toward them. That he'd made the mistake in trusting me and I overstepped boundaries. That civi's can't be trusted. How his last girlfriend had done the same thing to him by calling when he was just having a bad day. It was her fault the they'd roughed him up"". On and on. 

I could only tell him that I didn't have much choice. That I'm not their hugest fan the past couple years myself but he's expressing suicidal ideology, and I don't know who he has in his life he trusts. That no one was out to get him here and that I don't deserve to be punished for trying to do the decent human thing. And that I am not his girlfriend (only physical contact had been a quick hug as I left a few days ago). That if he reads his miles of texts it shows his PTSD in getting in the way of of non-professionals helping him right now and provided the local crisis line number. I wished him well and reminded him that I needed to be healthy and care of myself by blocking him. Done. Nothing nasty or confrontational. 

Thing is, some stupid part of me still wants to apologize and calm him down. I'd meant no harm at all but screwed up. I'm jumping at every little sound and feel as though I'm somehow ""in trouble"" for some misdeed. I don't think my cell block even works properly but I'm afraid to look and find out. Having been brought up being held responsible for others' unpredictable actions and fists slammed on me for not measuring up to babysitting them, it can grind a person down. After how long I'm finally starting to see that in me now? Jesus.

I was also just starting to get to the point in life of emotionally realizing that I'm not as obligated as I feel or as others have guilted me to feel. There's a tiny part in me that knows I don't deserve this dynamic, and even wants to say ""I don't owe you or anyone else anything. Get off my back"". It doesn't feel strong at the moment, but it's probably just tiredness, flu, and needing to go back to bed. What a bunch of high school crap.

But I do miss my home city. You can at least try to escape into the crowds if you need to get away. Maybe even utter a quick ""Fuck off, freak"" before running."
I had my first motorcycle crash and now I can't fall asleep anymo,"Hi guys, so I'm not really sure how to put this.

About 10 days ago I had a crash with my motorcycle where I got thrown off of it in a turn at 80kph.

Ever since the accident when I sleep I see the accident over and over in my dreams, because of this every night I have been sleeping less and less.

I have now come to the point that I am awake for nearly 40 hours and can't fall asleep anymore.

I guess what I'm trying to ask is, could this be some sort of PTSD? And how can i stop this? Because I really just want to  sleep but it just isn't working."
I often find myself disassociating,"Sometimes I don’t realize the extent of it until it hits me, sometimes it doesn’t. It’s like that slap in the face from reality when you’ve been oblivious or in denial for however long. Any time I am stressed out I disassociate. I feel like I’m walking through a dream. I space out often for long periods of time. When watching tv or having a conversation with someone half of what is said will not comprehend in my brain & the simplest of things confuse me. I tell myself that what’s happening is real life, but I don’t believe it until I come to. What are your experiences with disassociating?"
A bad abuse story in a book triggered my traumatic memories,"I had the worst panic attack today because of a very unexpected sexual abuse story in a book I read. It completely caught me off guard and I can't get it out of my head now. I thought I was getting better and now I have these horrible images in my mind, and it reminded me of things I experienced, though they weren't as bad as what I read. I don't know how to stop thinking about it. I don't have anyone to talk to about this, and it's really eating away at me so I thought I would just post this. I'm not usually this sensitive but what I read was just horrifying. :("
Nightmares Unrelated to the Accident?,"I was diagnosed with PTSD after I was hit by a car. My therapist and psychiatrists since then have told me I have PTSD. Right after the accident the nightmares I used to get were largely related to cars (think Mr. Mercedes-esque). However, as the time has gone by I still have the car related dreams but I also have dreams about my mother and father, us getting into fights, or me disappointing them badly. I wouldn’t think they’re related but aside from the storyline of the nightmare, they’re exactly the same as the car nightmares I had. 
Does anyone else experience this or anything similar? 
(Let me know if I need trigger warnings for anything)"
PTSD Related Loss of Appetite,So since the new year I’ve been struggling with my mental health and my appetite is gone. I’ve lost almost 8lbs when I really didn’t have weight to spare to begin with. When I eat though I have to choke it down and sometimes it comes back up. Has anyone found a solution to keeping weight on when they can’t eat? I’ve been living on smoothies and protein drinks but it’s not helping.
USA: PTSD & depression can be almost five times as high among firefighters and police officers than the general public.,"> **Mental Health and First Responders: How Their Jobs Can Cause More than Just Stress**
> 
> Firefighters, police officers, and other first responders never know what a day on the job is going to look like. Many of these people deal with high levels of trauma, and their mental health record is taking a toll.
> 
> First responders are at high risk of more than you think. While they often deal with dangerous and life-threatening situations on the job, the trauma and emotional stress that comes with their day-to-day can really affect their mental health and cause post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety—to name a few.

The same study found that Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and depression can be almost five times as high among firefighters and police officers than the general public.

Marijuana worsens my PTSD symptoms... last night was awful,"I marked this NSFW because idk policies about drug use here. So I'm a sophomore in college and have experimented a little bit with alcohol and marijuana (after growing up in a culture where no one drank or smoked at all... didn't even know people who did either). I have an insanely low tolerance. I drink maybe once every two or three weeks and smoke even less frequently. My boyfriend is a mild stoner and will smoke with his friends once a week or so, but it's not normally something we do together. Last night he invited me to come along and hang out with the guys. I took only two hits from the bong but the second one was really big. I'd never used one before and don't know how to use it, and I ended up coughing so hard I almost puked. 

Within three minutes, I was the highest I've ever been in my life. I felt like I was asleep and trapped in a dream, which is a familiar and terrifying feeling to me. Since I've developed PTSD, I've had recurring instances of sleep paralysis which leave me really shaken up. I ran out into the hallway and started having a panic attack. My heart was racing and I felt paralyzed and helpless and started shaking really violently, hyperventilating, and crying profusely. I was completely convinced I was asleep at my seat in the room and was astral projecting or something and not able to wake up. My boyfriend, bless him, chased after me and spent nearly 30 minutes calming me down and telling me that I'm safe and that this was real life. I must have asked him hundreds of times if I was asleep. I'm so grateful he's so patient. Once I was calm enough, he took me back to his dorm room, and we watched a bit of TV and went to sleep. He didn't let me go home, which was a good call.  I didn't fully believe him that I wasn't dreaming until I woke up this morning. 

I realize that I was probably just way too high, uncomfortably so, but has anyone else noticed that they react to weed differently because of their PTSD? I've heard that weed can be relaxing for some people, but it seems to have the opposite effect on me. Even when I've been very mildly high I've noticed I get quite a bit more anxious and paranoid. I don't think I'll be smoking again. It's not something I was super into in the first place and it seems like it doesn't sit well with me. I'll gladly pass next time."
Pain symptoms,"Part of hyper vigilance for me means my muscles are almost always clenched, I physically can’t relax them without help like a massage or cbd oil. As a result I’m in pain almost constantly. I get debilitating migraines and it’s painful to do simple things like put on my socks and shoes. Has anyone else experienced this physical symptom of ptsd? Did you find something that helps? Cbd oil is expensive and I can’t drive on it so I can’t always take it. Any suggestions would be appreciated."
Another Two Decades to Account for. Time Slips & PTSD.,"Just caught myself in a time slip and left wondering where the decades have gone.

I saw news coverage today linked to PTSD and the film ""Three Kings"" being 20 years since it was released. Then I realised I had a copy and it's still on my ""To Watch List"" and 20 years have gone by. 

To me it was yesterday - my memories are of Yesterday - emotionally it is yesterday - even socially it's all yesterday and yet it's 20 years of missing. 

Trying to get Joe Public and even Jo Medical Professional to grasp time slips and memory issues that relate to decades is all too often impossible. I just find it comical having a Swiss Cheese Memory in my Jello Brain."
Giving PTSD A First Class Licking.,">**U.S. Postal Service Issues 'Healing' Stamp to Help Americans Struggling With PTSD**
>
>Showing your support for military veterans and others afflicted with post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is now just a lick away. This week, the United States Postal Service (USPS) released a new Healing PTSD stamp, with proceeds going toward the assistance and treatment of service members and civilians struggling with emotional and psychological symptoms brought on by a troubling life event.
>
>The front of the stamp, which features a green plant growing from a pile of fallen leaves, is intended to symbolize healing. The stamp is what the USPS refers to as semipostal, which is postage that sells for a premium in order to raise funds for causes thought to be in the public interest. The Healing PTSD edition is 65 cents, or 10 cents more than a regularly-priced first-class stamp. That money, minus the postage paid and the reimbursement of reasonable costs acquired by the Postal Service, will be distributed to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and routed to the National Center for PTSD.

A Blood Test for PTSD? A potential “paradigm shift”.,">... researchers found the blood test had accurately diagnosed the disorder 77 percent of the time. 
>
>Achieving a positive blood test for PTSD could identify people who need additional assessment and treatment, but more research is needed before these findings can be applied in the field. Not only must the panel be tested on a much larger group of veterans, but more work is required to understand what PTSD looks like in women and when caused by scenarios other than combat. “We’re not declaring victory—game over—that these 28 are the magical 28 markers for men, women, civilians, firefighters, policemen, military, veterans,” Doyle says. “This is just the beginning. We don’t talk about one type of diabetes; we don’t talk about one cancer. One might expect that there’s not necessarily one stress disorder.”

Gave myself a black eye yesterday,"I’m just pissed off about it more than anything. I was trying to hurt myself in a way that wouldn’t show on the outside but couldn’t even manage that. I was just trying to not die, I mean it worked but now I have this stupid bruiser. My fiancé, I feel terrible for, because seeing someone you love pummel themselves is scary af. Also me having a black eye gives him anxiety when we’re out (people give him looks) and that fucking sucks, I feel terrible for him. This isn’t the first time, there have been too many incidents to count. I have antidepressants, therapy is available, family is loving and supportive. I’m so fucking lucky, but I can’t cope for shit. I can’t function man. I feel really stupid for even being in my situation. It never got better man, it just never got better"
Did Forrest Gump Have PTSD?,"Everyone hears the name Forrest Gump and thinks of ""life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."".

What many miss is the evidence of trauma and reaction to trauma.

* Forrest born into a single-parent family fighting poverty
* He's describes as slow-witted, a euphemism for learning disabled. 
* suffering painful physical disability from childhood
* He's othered and isolated in his community due to his disabilities
* fighting and overcoming disability by running
* replaced thought with physical activity as a coping mechanism
* Traumatised by war
* Injured in war
* Loss of significant life figures - His Mother - His sweetheart Jenny 
* Suffers natural disaster - Hurricane 
* When overly challenged by emotional events resorts to physical coping mechanisms and runs backwards and forwards across America. 
* His actions repeatedly attributed to other things by observers and his own experience and knowledge ignored

His life experiences are a primer for PTSD if not CPTSD. 

I wonder how different the sentimentality around the film would be If it was advertised as a PTSD movie?"
Weird Tip??,"I don't know if I have PTSD but I have extreme anxiety.

I noticed crossing my leg and sitting on my foot, or crossing my legs in general, relieves me overtime.

I remember watching a video on trauma release exercises and how trauma tends to accumulate around the psoas. It's also well known yoga helps with PTSD.

If Im going to sit on the computer for hours or sit, I don't have to put effort into crossing one of my legs and doing whatever I want to do.

Idk if it'd be weird to call it some lifehack."
To My Stalkers,"I went through a sort of long term mental breakdown awhile ago. Because it was noticeable, a lot of people either became concerned, or interpreted my symptoms as me being an asshole. 
Its become very aparent to me that my online activity is being monitored by some of these people. I'll post something and then have the exact topic brought up the next day. Or I'll vent about someone and their behavior changed the next day or they passive aggressively say something about it. I thought i was paranoid....... But some new evidence suggest that the things i have been noticing are real and that my fruends are gaslighting me. I'll probably delete all my accounts soon. But it sucks that I can't have this one place to ask for advice and vent. I haven't been able to find a therapist so its kinda been one of my only options to go online. Plus many people I once trusted have shown me that I cannot rely on them for the amount of issues I'm facing (they aren't bad for this, its a lot).

But yeah I fucking love being stalked. Reminds me of my abusive ex so thanks guys."

I can’t have fun anymore

I can’t even post a picture of me and my family having fun or me in makeup without getting creeps texting me. It really triggers me. People texting me “let me cum for you” “like to see u without clothes” I’m a teenager! I’m in high school! It’s very upsetting. It makes me have flashbacks. Even memes! It’s constant. I just want to disappear..."

I feel so hopeless and useless 
I cry every day 
I can’t sleep
I have no friends

I can’t keep fighting 
I’m just so tired"
I flinch every time someone touches me,"I don’t even know if I should post this here since I don’t want to self-diagnose ptsd or anything but here goes. 

My mom verbally and physically abused me for as long as I can remember. She slapped me when I told her I was depressed and she almost kicked me out of the house because she said she gave me everything and I was still ungrateful. She said it so much I think she’s right. My dad didn’t do anything except watch it happen because he’s been physically abused by her before. There have been aggressive verbal threats she’s thrown at me and I don’t want to say them here because it’s too painful. Every time I think about it I relive every moment but I feel like I need to write it here. 

I’ve woken up crying in the middle of the night in a cold sweat because I have nightmares about her. Only 2 more years until I’m moving out and that’s what’s keeping me going. 

Because of this relationship, any time she, my dad, or my friends touch me I flinch and start sweating profusely. I can’t help it it just happens. My heart rate goes up and I get scared they’re going to hit me. I don’t like hugs from anyone and if anyone raises their voice at me I’m already tearing up. Maybe it’s being over dramatic but I can’t help it. I want to make good, loving relationships with other people but I don’t think I can."
How do you know if you suffer from PTSD?,"I have a feeling I have PTSD. I’m constantly on edge, and I have been for months now. I have anxiety. I get scared at night that someone is going to hurt me (like my dad). I’m constantly on the verge of tears. There was a period of time a few months ago that I was hyper-vigilant. I started feeling weird things and I was scared of things happening (like monsters, for example). I felt numb. My dad hurt me almost two years ago, but it’s only really triggered me sometime late last year.  Is that even possible? I’m so anxious and nervous all the time to be touched by him or by my mom even (sometimes)."
It’s been almost two years and I’ve just been diagnosed with PTSD.,"I was sexually assaulted nearly two years ago. Today I thought I saw the perpetrator in his car (it wasn’t actually him, I just seem to think I see him more and more lately) and freaked out and had to stop, turn around and go home. Home is my safe place, whenever I feel threatened I just want to go home and lock myself away in my bedroom. 

I’ve been having a lot of very vivid nightmares lately about the assault and as a result have not been sleeping well. I’m afraid to go to sleep for fear of a nightmare and then when I do get to sleep, I’ll have a nightmare and then be up for the rest of the night. 

I went to the doctor this morning who knows I’ve suffered previously with depression and anxiety. She’s just diagnosed me with PTSD and referred me for urgent therapy as I am type one diabetic and confessed to her that last night I attempted an insulin overdose and was disappointed when I woke up this morning. 

I don’t know how to feel about being diagnosed with PTSD. It’s hard to accept but I also feel hopeful that now there’s a name being put to it, maybe I can target it easier and get better. 

What should I expect now?"
I am at university and I am struggling with PTSD. I can’t sleep at night and when I do I have several nightmares so I wake up tired and scared. And this effects my concentration with everything.

Does it ever get easier?,"I was hoping my issues would be something that would fade with time. Nothing is getting better even after going to counseling. I am having nightmares every night to the point that I’m grinding my teeth causing headaches, I’m scared at work because it gets noisy, I run around manic at work and end up making mistakes then obsess over those mistakes, I’m so ashamed of everything I like and feel I have to hide it even if it’s something like a song or book. I have been losing weight because I eat a little at work then stop. I throw my food away before my husband sees so he doesn’t know. People at work notice when something’s wrong but I still lie and say I’m fine. I lie to everyone saying it’s ok but I’m not ok. My counseling was concerned about me self harming but I don’t want to. I don’t want pain or to cause pain. I want my pain to stop. Talking about my intrusive thoughts causes me to have anxiety attacks. I’ve have at least two panic attacks a week. I feel like things are getting worse and worse. The more I open, the more it hurts."
Sexual assault,My brother sexually assaulted me as a child.I pretend that he doesn't exist but I'm triggered when I find his stuff in my personal space. I find it hard to do anything and can't even move. Is it always going to be like this?
I think I have ptsd,"So uhm I’ve posted once here about my partner having ptsd. And hearing a lot about ptsd from her has made me realize I show some symptoms of it and I’ve been think so for a few months. And towards the beginning of January some stuff has resurfaced that I’d forgotten. And things kept happening that I think might have been flashbacks. 
And last night a triggering thing came up for me, and I think I’ve been dissociating all day because of it. And earlier on the phone with my partner, I think I was having a flashback. It felt like I was back in middle school, where there was a lot of trauma, and I had a hard time being able to tell where I was and that recent things had happened. I could remember recent things, but they felt like a distant memory. 
And honestly I’ve been really scared to actually think about whether or not I actually do have ptsd as I’m afraid I’m pretending or that I’m encroaching. 
But tonight has made it impossible to not think about it and I’m not sure what to do. I looked up the symptoms and they almost all fit. And I took a test to see, which I realize isn’t the most reliable thing, and it said there was a high risk of it. 
I’ve kind mentioned it to my partner a bit as well in the last few weeks, and she said she wouldn’t be surprised at all if I did. But I still feel confused and am feeling some doubt and am not quite sure what to do at the moment.  And I think I just needed to get this all out there. But I’m also kinda looking for guidance because this is a whole new territory for me, and am very lost and confused."
I am just done,"I am drowning. In my depression and anxiety, I am constantly being plagued by nightmares and flashbacks. And I am done trying to be okay. I am not okay and the sad part is all the people in my life that say they “care” are nowhere to be found or too busy to even listen."

At the beginning they were 7 and 10. I have been sexually assaulted repeated times over my adolescent and early adult years and I was raped by a drug dealer while living abroad roughly one year ago. I have been in therapy for 10 years dealing with this. Since the beginning my parents have been completely supportive and have been making up for the fact that, due to secrecy and manipulation, they couldn't protect me when I was little. 

&#x200B;

I moved back home about 6 months ago after living abroad, which is, unfortunately, the location of most of my abuse. Despite the development symptoms, I landed a dream job at a law firm. Then I had to quit within one week because my symptoms were so bad. Thankfully I got accepted into grad school last minute. But now that is starting and I feel very disconnected socially. I also had to cut my closets sibling out of my life due to some recent traumatic interactions.

&#x200B;

3/4 days ago I experienced a flashback for the first time in my entire life. 20 years of emotional pain just flooded over me. I have been dissociating and having multiple flashbacks since then. They are fucking terrifying. No other word for it.

&#x200B;

Now I am back in school and it's the second week of class and I cannot bring myself to go. and I love school. I am studying to be a teacher. But I am terrified of having a flashback in the middle of class or on campus.  Also, dissociating in public repeatedly and hyperarousal all feel so exhausting. I also deal with dermatitis artefacta and intense nightmares. It's so hard to concentrate when I am exhausted.

&#x200B;

Any kind words or coping strategies that have worked for you would be greatly appreciated right now. I'm feeling very lonely and I want to start connecting with the outside world again."
Does it ever change?,"I’m having flashbacks and dissociating rn so I apologize if this is all kinda loopy. 
Just as background info (skip over this if you’d like) I have PTSD and a series of traumas that have built upon it. The first when I was a year old then again when I was three, an event that wasn’t really traumatic but it kinda set off repressed feelings from my childhood traumas I didn’t know about and led me to learn of said traumas and the last an abusive relationship at 16.

I’m 18 now and I’ve made so so much progress forward but sometimes I wonder if I’ll always be stuck like this. I wonder if I’ll ever stop having flashbacks, I wonder if I’ll ever be okay with even the thought of anything sexual. I wonder if things would be different if I had just one less trauma, if the most recent one never happened would I be as bad as I am now? Would I even have flashbacks because they didn’t start until that trauma. 
I’m pretty happy where I’m at in life but the flashbacks still suck, it’s been two fucking years and it feels like nothing’s really faded away and I just kind of fear I’ll never fully recover. I’m sorry I feel like this is getting ranty I just need a release right now. I’ve almost accepted that I’ll probably never fully recover but it’s still an awful thought.
As I sit here shaking and crying I wonder if I’ll ever be able to shake the feeling that I’m not a liar, I wonder what if I was just stronger when I reached out for help if I had held my ground in what my truth was instead of just breaking down and apologizing and apologizing when I told the truth and everyone pointed at me saying I lied. Maybe that’s what holds me back so much is just wishing I was stronger back then in that moment.

Sorry this is all probably confusing and, sorry. Thanks for reading if you did"
Dealing with toxic family members,"
My immediate family members are not safe people to say the least. I find when they attempt to contact me, either it be a text or a call. My body tenses up and I become very anxious. Just the idea of interacting with them can be triggering. And, I end up wanting to literally hide and shut out all noise and light. I end up sitting on the floor in my closet in the dark completely drained and scared of what may happen. Anyone else go through this?"
Fear of running into the person who sexually assaulted me,"I am diagnosed, was abused growing up, molested, sexually assaulted. I get this fear of running into the person that sexually assaulted me, any advice on how to cope with this fear? 

I always imagine something really bad happening, and that he will be the powerful person and I will be powerless again."
Dissociation and driving,"Has anyone had to stop or limit driving because of episodes? I had a big one the other day and drove nearly 45km at high speed (the speed limit, I use cruise control) and can’t really remember it. It’s really frightening, because I don’t get much it any warning when I’m going into it.  In all honesty, other times it’s been really short and less than 2 minutes but this one floored me. 

I drive a lot to many appointments, usually a 2,3,4 hour round trip. I’m not sure what to do."
Am I Crazy?,"I've been diagnosed with PTSD for 2 years now. I was a child that lived in a home with an abusive drug addict dad for 12 years.
 I've watched my little brother get thrown in between a dock and a boat, i've been held underwater, and I've seen much more. I have an irrational fear of water that I cant touch or see the bottom of, but the thing is, I REMEMBER that stuff and why I'm afraid of it.

Why cant I remember how I lost the tip of my ear?

Since I was a kid, I've had a piece if my ear missing. The part at the top that folds over like a sort of rim is missing on my Left ear. The thing is, I dont know how I lost it. I cant ask my mother because she left my dad when my brother and I were very young, and I havnt seen my dad in 6 years. 

There are triggers that I cant understand either. 
I think I was in some sort of car crash or an accident of some kind. Maybe I watched someone get hurt really bad, because I get panic attacks every time I see things like people vomiting blood in movies, or hear yelling or people in pain. This happened a lot even when I took my first aid training. (They're not as intense anymore, but sometimes I still tear up and get a bit winded)

My best guess for the longest time was that when my dad pushed my -at the time, infant brother- out of the kitchen sink while bathing him. Maybe I saw blood and heard him cry or something, but I dont remember anything about it, other than a fuzzy memory of what I believe to be me looking up at my mom's shocked expression. 

Has anyone else had this feeling you remember something but cant at the same time? Or maybe feel like theres a huge chunk of your memories missing? 
I had a stressful year in 2016 and my therapist noticed that I couldn't recall almost the entire year because of my mother's abusive boyfriend. Couldn't remember anything until I saw an old video of him doing the knife game.

I feel like I need I try to find a way to remember, but these two questions have been in my head for a long time."
I can’t relax...,I can’t concentrate or get anything done. I keep anticipating that something bad is going to happen and I need to be ready for whatever it is. It is draining me of all my reserves for the day. I can’t take it. I have resorted to hiding in my bedroom closet.

Best friend needs help,"Hey guys,
I hope this is an okay place for this. My best friend works as a first responder and has had some- bad calls he had to go on. He has PTSD and he's having nightmares and seeing the faces of the people he lost. As far as I can tell he hasn't had any triggering incidents at work. But his first child is coming this week. Is there anything I can do to try and help? Or any techniques he could try and get himself grounded again?"
I dont know what to do,So my brother killed himself in 2015 and I have ptsd from how close I was to him and I've tried therapy and meds for the depression that seems to consume me. Nothing has worked and I feel lost. I dont know what there is to do I have tried everything I know and nothing helps. They say it's better to feel pain than feel nothing. I would rather be numb than be in the constant pain I've been in the last 4 years. What do I do
Ruling my life,How do I keep PTSD from dictating what I do? How do I conquer it? It is conquering me.
Does this sound like PTSD?,"I know it's always best to see a professional to get a diagnosis, I am currently in the process of it, but I'm just trying to understand my illnesses better. So here I am to share a bit of my experience and get some input. I was mentally abused by my father and was also in a mentally/physically abusive relationship for 3 years. I went to therapy for at least two and a half years. For a while at the age of 11 and after that from 16-17. I was forced to go, so I was never really open during those sessions and didn't want to talk about what I was going through. I was diagnosed with clinical depression during that time. I haven't been diagnosed but I know with absolute certainty that I have anxiety as well. 

Anyway, the reason why I'm thinking I might have PTSD is because anytime anyone yells at me or even just talks loudly, seems mad at me, or just reminds me of my abuse, I COMPLETELY shut down. Worst case, I get a super intense panic attack and start to cry uncontrollably and cannot be calmed down. Shaking, hyperventilating, unable to speak, dry heaving, maybe start hitting myself, detachment from reality, my mind just completely breaks. It usually takes me 30 minutes to an hour to be able to think clearly. This doesn't happen that often though, in the past year this has happened maybe 5 times. Usually I might either get a mild panic attack or just feel extremely anxious. Does this sound like PTSD to you?"

How to quiet startle response,"Any advice?  I’ve come a long way since my diagnosis.  Sleep most nights.  Able to go out most days.  But I still have exaggerated startle responses.  It’s better than it was.  I once broke a shower door because I saw the shower curtain out of the corner of my eye and just started punching.  I’m good usually and only yell a bit if someone enters the room and startles me.  My peripherals are still a problem, though.  I was walking on the street and a college girl passed me on the right which is her right to do because I’m old and a bit slow and I almost knocked her into the store window.  And the strength of my response scared me because it’s instant, ya know?  It’s not something I can reason through.  I don’t want to hurt anybody.  Anybody have some cbt techniques or advice that’s worked for you?  Please and thank you."
Treatment,"Well after finishing 12 weeks of a trauma therapy program, I’m going to go away to “residential” treatment. I was like “wtf,” is this even voluntary? Turns out it is. I could have stayed home and continued trying to fix myself. I completed a trauma level 1 program and opted to go the intensive route by completing the next step the right way. I have to be away from everyone and can’t have electronics. I will miss you, Reddit! 
I finished the program I was in with many women who are vets or have husbands serving. I think this was the key for me to really accept my PTSD. I didn’t fully absorb it before seeing these women react to situations and explain their emotions the way I did. We’re not crazy. We aren’t “overly emotional.” You give an asthmatic an inhaler for a reason. You give someone with severe, chronic PTSD skills to avoid panic attacks, flashbacks and nightmares for the same reason; in that regard, its all the same. Trauma itself is much like pain: you can’t compare it. It is what it is. When you’re stuck in fight or flight mode, you need to learn skills to turn it off. This is through DBT. I have been panic attack free for awhile now, have not had self harming thoughts, or any other “crazy” feeling that could potentially occur due to PTSD. It’s all brain damage.
Most trauma treatment is voluntary, and you need to find them on your own. I highly recommend each of you find a psychologist- not a “therapist” to treat PTSD. My trauma occurred in my childhood. My psychologist now treats adults, but many of us were abused as children. His background is working with dyfus cases and treating children. Get a good psychiatrist you can trust- I am on 6 medications: 2 for nightmares and sleep, 2 for anxiety, and 2 for depression. NO ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDS BECAUSE IM NOT CRAZY.
PTSD is brain damage, and that’s how it needs to be treated.
I’m extremely mistrusting of the system and had to do this all my way. My husband is a great support, and I know many of you don’t have the support you need. I’m praying for you.
I hit the lottery when I found my psychologist. He wanted me to face my trauma last year by doing this, and I couldn’t because I knew i wasn’t ready. 2 years after starting therapy, I had the courage to do this.
My point is; no matter what state or insurance you have, it’s your responsibility to take care of your mental health to the best of your ability and capacity. 
I wish you all the best as I say bye to Reddit and begin the next chapter in my journey. Going to the west coast VOLUNTARILY so I can leave behind some mistrust, anger, and worry and do what I need to do the right way - no visitors, no contact 30 days. Feels like jail for my broken mind 😩🤪😅🥰
Anyone who has ever loved or trusted me should know, nothing has changed. I will always love them and protect them the best way I can."
I hate the insominia,"Can't sleep. Nothing helps. I hate when these thoughts intrude in my mind, and all I do is cry. Sometimes I just want to die. But I wont, I keep living and hoping that one day all these memories will be gone so that I can move on. I just want some peace."
I think I have PTSD. Would like some support.,"I (18,FtM) never really thought I had PTSD. I had some symptoms like flinching at certain sounds or movements, and dissociating a couple times (not really fully) but I never really thought I had PTSD. I grew up with a lot of physically abusive parental figures and that always was upsetting but I never had flashbacks or nightmares. But about a week ago I was thinking a thing my dads ex wife did to me and I completely lost it and had a full on flashback for the first time. I haven’t really been the same I keep dissociating for seemingly no reason and I already kinda already had a trigger for loud banging noises and now it’s gotten super sensitive and things that weren’t that bad before are scaring me. I am not diagnosed and I don’t think people should self diagnose so I am not saying I do or don’t have PTSD but I think it is possible. I am actually going to an intake to get a new counselor tomorrow so I’ll look into it when I have a professional to talk to. 

Side note: I’m not really sure what counts as triggering by the rules I read them they were just kinda confusing to me so if it is triggering please let me know and I’ll mark it but I tried my best to be vague."
Hi,You are my fellow messed up people 😁. It's funny but I'm a bit paranoid as I'm posting. I'm looking out a window looking for any threat. I've just started my journey as I come to terms with he fact that I have PTSD. I finally admitted it. For those of you who have been in therapy for awhile and know how to manage this. What is some advice you have?
"Just diagnosed, 24 years after the primary event. Hoping maybe you guys can help answer a question?","I’m going through cognitive behavioral therapy (the writing type) and my therapist told me to hand write everything to prevent dissociation. I’ve heard of dissociation but only the most severe types with fugue or losing time etc. I’ve lost time before but I never really thought about it or even knew what it was until a recent job interview I don’t remember actually doing, just going in and coming out. I’m rambling because of insomnia, sorry. I’ve always done this thing where I sit in the back of my head and dispassionately observe my physical reactions to emotional events. Like even if I’m physically sobbing I don’t feel it in my head if that makes sense, I just watch myself cry and keep analyzing the situation and just sort of ignore my body. Is this dissociation? I don’t want to know what to do about it, I’m going to therapy and she’s amazing, I’ve just got a few days before my next session and I’m curious. Because now that I’ve handwritten my trauma narrative I’m not doing that and my brain is fuzzy as fuck and this goddamn hurts. So hopefully actually feeling this can mean the boil is lanced as it were? Anyway, love y’all and I hope your day/night is pleasant and restful."
Questioning,"I tend to second guess everything including my own thoughts, likes and dislikes, reality, etc. 

I am seeing a therapist and I explained to her that I am questioning if even I have C PTSD. I told her maybe I don’t have it and that maybe I just needed to get over myself. Her reaction bothered me. She kinda laughed but not in a way she thought what I said was funny. It was more I said something ridiculous or stupid. Honestly it is really hard to tell."
Is this really PTSD?,"I've recently been diagnosed with complex PTSD. I guess I'm kind of baffled by this up to a point, though I've been witness to many traumatic things growing up and into my 20s, try hard as I might but I really have nearly zero emotional connection to these traumatic things that have happened in my past. Moreover, what perplexes me is that I've been falling in and out of depression for the past ten years, I thought PTSD was more chronic and not something that flairs up and goes away when triggered by life's uncertainties and stressful situations that remind you of the past. It was recommended by my therapist that I undergo EMDR and to also start taking antidepressants. Anyone have a similar circumstance? Looking forward to feedback in general. Thank you."
mental gap between trauma and diagnosis,"this is literally the number one thing NOT to do when diagnosed with PTSD, but i am really feeling like my trauma wasn’t “bad enough” for the diagnosis. sometimes i question the trauma in general and wonder if i just overreacted. tonight has been really bad with it and i don’t know how to stop this mental block that i have because i know that i shouldn’t compare trauma but it’s just so damn hard :("
Help coping with nightmares,"Hi all,
     SO recently got the official PTSD diagnosis after the year passed from his traumatic event. He has been having vivid nightmares multiple times a week and now dreads sleeping. I have suggested meditation, energy work and some self soothing tips, all of which helps me cope with my personal trauma history and bad dreams. Unfortunately, nothing seems to be working for him. We both are feeling lost as to how best to help him. Anyone have any advice that works for you? 

Thanks in advance!"
9 years and I still can’t sleep,"I survived the 22/7 terror attack in Norway back in 2011. I was on Utoya island where 69 people died.

I lost 3 friends there and I still suffer from horrible survivors guilt. I saw and heard people getting shot  right behind me and I just kept running. I was so fucking scared, but I still get flashbacks and lie awake at night thinking about the people I might‘ve been able to help. I didn’t know them, but I will never be able to get their screams out of my fucking head.

I remember seeing Anders Breivik maybe 20 feet away from me, and the moment I saw him firing his rifle my mind went to a place I can’t even describe. You hear stories about people being heroes and helping others. I ran and hid like a fucking coward. I saw people helping others. I saw so many brave people that day, but I wasn’t one of them. I keep thinking that maybe the number of people killed could’ve been 67 or 68 instead of 69 had I just stopped and helped. I fucking hate myself for it and I don’t know if I’ll ever look at myself the same way again."
Can't deal with it,"I don't know what to do anymore. I had 2 good weeks, and it came back the ptsd and depression always come back.... Sugar always makes me depressed, and I stupidly had some. I'm assuming this weekend was a delayed reaction, but holy shit. I can't deal with it right now. I want to run away. But I can't deal with loneliness. I'm working on moving overseas, but I just don't care about anything. I don't want anything. I'm not excited about anything. The depression and memories are too much. I didn't get out of bed the entire day except to shower, and now I'm eating... after midnight. I don't want to go to work tomorrow. The last several years have been hell. My only hope is that the sugar will wear off, and I'll be okay. I'm never okay for long."
I got the worst trigger I’ve ever had (Trigger Warning: mentions of child abuse),"I have been through child abuse a lot, and I just saw a kid who got hit hard. I didn’t react to it much when I saw, but it’s just now starting to affect me and I am really stressed. My chest hurts from the stress. Sorry if my post doesn’t follow etiquette. I just wanted to tell someone. Also, I’m gonna possibly be overzealous and mark this as NSFW to make sure I’m not breaking the rules"
PTSD and relationships?,Any advice on how to stop self sabotaging romantic relationships when you have PTSD? I’m in a relationship with someone great and I’m so afraid of ruining it because of it.
Flashbacks. I don’t know where to look for help.,"When I was little, like 3, I was physically and mentally  abused by my babysitter. She would force me to sleep outside in 100+ degree weather under the sun, she would separate me from the other kids for no reason, and she would dunk my head into the toilet until things got dark in my vision. 

While I acknowledged that when I was about 15 in the psych ward, I’ve (now 20) have been getting really weird flashbacks and I’ve been (somewhat tying these to behaviors I have/had). And to be honest, I’m confused and lost.

Basically, I started getting flashbacks of my baby sitters floor plan. Also, I started getting flashbacks of her walking me to the bedroom where her husband was (I called him the “tickle monster”) and closing the door on us. That all I remember. It’s been happening for about 3 months. I sometimes feel like my head is making this up. 

Anyways, this allowed me to realize a few things:
- I’ve always ran from guys who liked me
- I’ve always had a constant thought in my head “I’d rather kill myself than get into a relationship”
- My severe fascination since 3 with sadomasochist ideas.

But like I said, I don’t know how to process this or where to look. I als feel like I am making all of this up because there’s still not a lot of emotion like i would assume ptsd to look like”"
I don't remember what happened to me.,"I was diagnosed with ptsd about 3 years ago and my trauma was about 9 years ago. That time in my life is so hazy and confusing and there are a lot of extended periods of time that i have no recollection of. The problem is that I don't know what specifically happened that traumatized me. I know a bit about the circumstances and surrounding issues, but there is not a moment i can pin point that could have caused this. My family and therapist have speculated that it was some form of sexual assault but it feels so weird not even knowing if that happened or not. What if I am making that up? What if it is a lot worse than what i think it is? What if i never remember? How can i heal if i don't even know how to identify the wound?"
PTSD Yoga,Has anyone heard/tried this? My DBT therapist has recommended I try this; issue is I’ve never heard of it before and I’m not very flexible nor have I ever been a fan of yoga before.
I'm getting better....sort of?,"So I've had ptsd (or been diagnosed) for a while now, and I've been doing a lot better! My flashbacks have decreased (havent had one in just over a month, I used to have them maybe once a few days) and my sleeping is alright. However, there was a problem in which my gf had a seizure in June, she had broke her shoulder and dislocated it. Now she's had her surgery and is in physical therapy. She also got diagnosed with endo after a surgery for that as well. 


My problem is that I'm having problems with that, still. It all happened back in October/November. I still freaked out over her surgeries long after, I still have moments where I freak out really badly over them. I ended up starting to smoke again because I couldn't deal with it. This is because I'm a former emt and I have bad intrusive OCD and end up in a loop where everything keeps going wrong and I can't protect her even when things go well. What has ended up happening is she goes to a clinic that has every specialist from orthopedic to neuro to urology to gyno, and then some more, including radiology and such. I hadn't really had a problem going to this clinic until after her surgeries. I can't go in, I panic, I cry. I get intensely angry when she says she has an appointment. I can't even drive by there without my heart rate jumping. 

What makes this worse is that the clinic is next to both the ER and surgical centers she had her surgeries at. And I feel terrible because, despite my therapy over it, I can't go in. And she feels bad because she wants my support but it makes me too upset. I hate myself and so it's making it worse. 

So I mean, I'm getting better, when it's anything that's NOT this. And basically, I hate it. 

TLDR: my ptsd related to anything that isn't involving my gf's surgeries/seizure and the clinic she goes to is getting better. That, is very much getting worse."
Recently diagnosed,It feels weird to have a PTSD tag when you’re young. I didn’t believe I’d have such thing at 18 and it’s really messing with me.

"I think I may have seen my ex (who I have a lot of trauma associated with) for the first time in 4 years at a bar last night, or someone who looks exactly like her, and I’m losing my mind about it, and I don’t know why.","The strangest thing is that I don’t even know if it was actually her. My friend even pulled out his phone and checked her Facebook pics and said he didn’t think it was her, but I’m still not convinced. I’m just going off memory and the pictures I have of her from when we dated. But if it wasn’t her, it was someone who basically looked like a clone of her that dresses the exact same way she does.

The thing that I find strange about it is that it seems like it doesn’t really matter to me if it actually was her or not. It seems to be a massive trigger for me either way. And even if I *did* see her, I don’t even understand what my reaction is to her or why this is making me feel so awful. I have a lot of abandonment trauma from my whole life that she unearthed when she broke up with me, and the breakup itself was the traumatic event that caused all my symptoms to come to the surface 6 years ago. So I guess....something along those lines.

I just don’t know what to do or feel."
Should I return to the scene of the trauma or not?,"Last year I had a severe, prolonged medical crisis. I was in and out of the hospital over the entire year and have severe PTSD from a lot that happened. My condition is lifelong and requires annual checkups to track growth (not cancer but behaves similairly). It's my first progress checkup since the initial crisis coming this week. I need to undergo a series of tests and scans at the hospital thatost everything happened at followed by a visit with the doctor that treated me. All of this over the course of two days. Now my wife and I are in the middle of a cross country move. We're moving in about 4 weeks and am wondering if it would be best for my PTSD to get my checkup after we move. The scans and tests can be done anywhere and in today's day and age my doctor can review them and consult with me remotely. Also it's not going to hurt me to wait the few weeks. I'm non symptomatic. I'm just thinking more in terms of what would be best for my PTSD. Should I get everything done at the original hospital this week and face my fears? Or would it just do more damage to my fragile mental state and early stages of recovery? I don't want to feel like I'm running away but I don't want to cause more harm by going. Not sure what to do. Any input would be great. Thank you."
"My app. w/ my Psychiatrist was amazing. He said ""First when i met you, you were terrified to leave your house. Now you have a job and a roof. I am very proud of you"".","And he said he has 100 clients only 5 perserving and wanting to get better. I am one of them. And he used my progress without my name at a conference!!! Ive seen him the past 4 years. 

I was so shocked because i never realized how bad it was. I dont even remember feeling that way. 

People with loved ones mentally ill, dont forget to compliment how hard they trying, and point out their milestones."
Advice needed: women-friendly alternative to therapy," 

I am going through broke and hard times right now. My symptoms are through the roof.

Recently, I had a whole new trauma, which I can classify as number 3 on my list. I mean, I have met a lot of evil people in my life, so one has to really do some damage to get to number 3.

I tried 7cups, but it was quite hostile. Some guys were there just to hook up and chat with women.

With others I felt like infront of a jury. Terrible atmosphere really.

So, my question is?

What are my options for free support online?

Am I totally fucked?

I need someone to talk to, at the very least."
Psychedelic Therapy,How can I get this done? My marriage is almost totally destroyed by this illness.  I'm constantly bashing my head against walls when I get rejected or criticized.  I'm losing control.  I could fly to Amsterdam within a week if I could found out how to get the therapy I need.
Urgent: I'm going to be hospitalized and I have PTSD from hospitals. Do any of you have advice?,"Last Monday, I gave myself a week to live before committing suicide. Monday is my suicide day. I've got everything in order. But I have one tiny bit of my brain that wants to live, and that means me being hospitalized for my own safety.

The problem is, I was committed to a mental institute for several months in my teenage years. I was mistreated there by both staff and other patients to the point where I have PTSD from it. I was hospitalized several other times too, and was either ignored or mistreated. I feel a flashback coming on just writing this.

I don't know what to do. I know that if I want to live, I have to be hospitalized before Monday comes. But I'm so scared of being abused or mistreated. Last time I was in the emergency room, I had horrible flashbacks and kept throwing up.

TLDR; I need to be hospitalized but a lot of my PTSD is from hospitals so I'm scared it'll make things worse. Please, please, please, if any of you have any suggestions, let me know."
Thunderstorm (possible triggerwarning),I have to be at school tomorrow but I cant sleep. The rain is tapping the window 1 foot away from my head and every time i hear the thunder it's like I'm being punched in the gut.

Don't want to leave the basement again,"Hes everywhere I look

I cant get away from that look on his face. When I open my phone his picture pops up, or a text from him asking ""sexy, what's up?"" 
I cant get away... no matter how far I sprint, or how many times I prick my fingertips
 My self hatred makes me look at his pictures when I'm having a good day, and draw him when Im starting to forget what he looks like
 I'm so afraid to let go.. but I want to because I still know that He lives so close to me, what if he still watches me? I'm starting to not to want to leave my home again, or walk out of my basement. It feels safer underground, but even down there I can still listen to his voice, it sounds."
Dissociation in a few words...,"The world around me continues to move

No relief in sight

I endure the pain

):,"(TW: possible r*pe, sexual trauma)
there’s a lot of backstory and i apologize 

for as long as i can remember, i’ve always had this memory: i’m young (maybe 2 or 3?) and in diapers. i was at my grandparents house. at the time, my aunt was still living with her, and she had a boyfriend (we will call him E). well one day, when my nanny and aunt weren’t around (or maybe they were, but i don’t remember; lots of parenthesis, i’m sorry), E was chilling out there. i don’t know why or for how long. but i vividly remember being taken upstairs so he could “change my diaper.” i remember being in my nanny’s bedroom floor, laying on my back, and feeling lots of pressure between my legs. this may be tmi, and i’m sorry, but it almost felt like i was constipated (and now that i’m typing this, i remember having problems going to the bathroom as a child too, right around/after the time all this took place... f***).

as i’ve looked back on my childhood over the years, i’ve started piecing things together. i wasn’t ever okay like a child should be. i constantly wanted to rub against things for s*xual pleasure, even though i didn’t know that’s why i was doing it. but the weird thing is i always *knew* in a way what s*x was. and it terrified me. 

if my parents were too affectionate to one another, i would cry. if i found my moms underwear (specifically thongs) like in her bathroom or something after a shower, i’d cry. 

as i got older, i would figure out more and more about the deed. and for as long as i can remember, if i suspect someone is having s*x in another room, i get scared. and what doesn’t make sense is i LOVE having it now. 

but here’s my problem. 

i’m currently at a friends house. her and her boyfriend are very affectionate to one another, and i’m okay with that. however, if it sounds like they’re having sex in the other room, i get scared shitless. 

i’m 21F and shouldn’t feel like this, but i’ve always felt so trapped. there’s a lot more to the story, but this pretty much wraps it up i guess. i’ve never been diagnosed by a doctor, but i do believe i have some form of PTSD. how do i cope with this??"

"I'm pretty pissed and fuck you, FBI","Two years ago, I reported my sister to the FBI for some serious shit that she has done.  Two days ago, I got into a 2 hour screaming match with an agent over what the hell was he doing and what are they doing about it. He told me that, because of the Epstein/Weinstein cases, my case took the back burner. And the case was shut down.

Ok, so, if the case is shut down because of that, I'm going to do anything and everything to take this bitch down.  You have no idea what a monster she is...

Coping skills to be more productive?,"Hey guys! I'm taking on too much and my coping skills are starting to fail me. I've been on top of my PTSD, no debilitating flashbacks in a year, made new friends... anyway I'm completing my last semester in school. I also just got my first full time job in years.

I'm... not balancing this well. I mean I haven't dropped any balls yet and everyone at the new job seems thrilled with my work, so maybe I am balancing. But I dread going into work because it's still unfamiliar, and I feel overwhelmed so I feel paralyzed which means I'm not doing what I need to for school. I try to study and I immediately feel super defeated (fixing my self talk helps here but not always). My mental health is somewhat deteriorating, I'm more on edge, im having the occasional nightmare, and I'm having to double up on sleep aids every night. I'm also not doing some of the basics, like going to the grocery store.

So clearly I'm masking some mental health stuff.

I want to succeed. I'm willing to fight through this, I just need to find a way to manage the paralyzation. Reminding myself why I'm going to school worked wonders the first week... but that's starting to wear off and I'm falling behind.

Any advice?"
Sad. I dont want to do anything anymore,Deleted
"Not diagnosed, but I think I may have given myself PTSD after a seizure.","To start off I know that a lot of people have had seizures much worse than mine but it's all still so new to me that by writing it out it's helping me to process. It still doesn't seem like something that ""happens to me"".

I was a groomsman in my best friend's wedding. I had never had a seizure or any symptoms of epilepsy. I was feeling fine that day, I had slept fine, we're a religious bunch so there was no drinking or drugs or anything like that at the bachelor party - no alcohol ever in fact. I was having a good time, visiting with friends, standing in a wedding, etc. It was at my church that I go to a few times a month. We were taking wedding pictures afterword when suddenly I got that ""super hungry"" feeling, when you are so hungry you are dizzy, but times a hundred. I had just eaten an hour ago. I lost my hearing, I could barely see. I thought to myself ""maybe I should sit down and let this - whatever this is - pass"". The last thing I remember is starting the movement to sit down on the grass since we were outside for pictures. I put my hand out, as one does when they're going to kneel/sit on the grass. It all happened in about fifteen seconds - not quite enough time for me to be very worried.

Immediately after I heard muffled voices. I couldn't see anything. A moment later I realized they were directed at me. ""Can you hear me?"" Why can't I answer? ""Can you hear me?"" Still dark. I tried to nod my head that yes I could hear. ""Can you hear me?"" I nodded. I don't remember sitting up, as far as I knew I was never laying down. No time had passed, yet everything was dark and muffled and my head hurt. ""I'm just sitting down,"" I said.

""You've had a seizure, you were out for six minutes,"" it was the voice of the bride's uncle who happened to be an off-duty EMT. Both of the bride's parents were also there, one is a nurse the other an anesthesiologist. ""Do you understand? You've just had a seizure.""

""No I didn't."" In my mind there was no six minute gap. I would have noticed, right?

""The ambulance is on its way, just sit down, don't try to stand up.""

Okay. I'll just sit here. The reality of what had happened was slowly starting to set in. I had the strangest feeling in my chest, everything was starting to look so bright, much brighter than usual. My heart was going so fast yet I was so tired.

I looked down at my drawstring bag next to me and saw both used epi-pen cartriges (they are a new-ish brand called Auvi-Q in which the cap comes off) (in very rare cases anaphylaxis can cause a seizure but this is not what happened in my case, however they did the best with the information they had - my peanut allergy is bad enough that my doctor requires I carry two epipens wherever I go, thankfully I'm very careful and have never had to use them for allergies). It hadn't quite set in yet that they had actually used them on me.

Fifteen minutes later the ambulance arrived, and I remember the EMT helping me up asking me to come with him. At some point someone had taken off my jacket and tie. It was on the ground and I walked by it - I didn't know what it was but I knew it was mine and I should probably grab it. The EMT stopped me, I don't remember how. Everything is so scrambled.

I got myself into the ambulance as far as I know. I was not on a stretcher and never was. I sat in the seat just looking at the EMT, I could see his face but it wasn't quite registering for some reason. He asked for my insurance card so he knew which hospital to take me to (there were plenty within a quick distance), and I picked up my bag, took out my wallet, and handed my insurance card to him.

""How old are you?"" 

""Twenty... twenty... twenty one?"" (I'm twenty two) 

""What's today's date?"" 

""...when?"" 

""Today"" 

""...July."" (It was September 28th) 

""What is your date of birth?""

At this point I'm starting to get pretty frustrated. I know the answers to all of these questions without having to think, what is going on with me?

""I don't know.""

""Do you know what happened?""

""I had a seizure.""

I don't remember the rest of the ambulance ride. I don't remember the ER although I was told that I walked in myself. I don't remember the last thing I said to the EMT or being checked in or changing into the gown or anything. The first thing I remember for sure is looking up at the ceiling as I was on the bed getting a CT scan. They had painted the ceiling to look like a sky. When I saw this it was almost like I came back into my body. I was suddenly ""all there"" again. I have vague memories of what happened before but not really. The quickness of it all is hard to explain.

I walked back to my room in the ER and my family was there. I remembered that they were going to be there waiting for me even though I don't remember leaving the room with them all in it.

They had me go pee in a cup and after I was done I looked up and saw myself in the mirror. I was much paler than usual, I looked like a ghost (I'm American but the majority of my ancestry is Finnish so I'm already quite pale). There were a bunch of red dots under my severely bloodshot eyes. I was so sore I could barely walk back to the room.

From this point on everything is fairly clear. What bugs me however is how much before, during, and after is made up or fabricated by my mind. For example, there are about 20 minutes before that I have no memory of except for the aura (probably because of the intensity of it). In fact, during my post-ictal state my memory is ""there"" but extremely fuzzy, but I have *absolutely* no memory for a long time before. It was all wiped and has never come back. I saw pictures on facebook weeks later of the wedding party that I don't remember taking. Lots of them. And I looked fine in them, I don't look like I was just trying to have a good time or worried about anything or feeling off in any way. According to my friends who were there I was acting normal all the way up until the aura hit.

Also according to the people who were there (a nurse and an EMT who saw the whole thing) it was definitely an epileptic seizure, not a ""psychogenic"" seizure. Not even close.

What messes with me even more is learning that things I knew for sure never actually happened. For example, it was one of the other groomsmen that found my insurance card out of my bag. I never touched the bag on the ambulance or before. I remember so strongly doing it myself.

I saw so many doctors and neurologists. I got poked and prodded and had the MRIs and EEGs done, all came up clean. They don't believe me that it was epileptic, they think that because I have had a history of anxiety in the past that it was psychogenic, but it was not. I know this because of the medical professionals who saw it all.

I was not breathing for almost four minutes (we'll get back to that), I had gone from pale to blue to purple to grey. My eyes were wide open, I was not making noise, I was shaking rhythmically and symmetrically, I was not responding to anything people were saying, I have no memory of the event (I was actually in denial for hours), and I had a very strong post ictal state. This, along with the burst capillaries in my face and the sore muscles, all points away from psychogenic.

Since then I have had vision, hearing, and balance issues. I saw an ophthalmologist who is the only doctor so far who has taken me seriously. He suggests that the double vision I was having was hypoxic brain damage, as is the vertigo that comes with it. He said it would heal in time. For many weeks I felt as though I wasn't real (to this day I still am dissociated but not quite as much), and I still have visual and balance problems. My visual field shakes just like that horrible optical image stabilization that phone cameras have. It makes me nauseous. It's almost like that moving snake optical illusion even though it's a still image, but all the time.

I've had auras since then which typically send me into a panic because I don't want to wake up with even more brain damage. It's all I can think about. I'm legally allowed to drive again but I will not get behind the wheel of a car. The thought gets my heart racing.

I had a nightmare one night right as I was falling asleep or had just fallen asleep that I was lying in bed and had the loudest ringing in my ears that I've ever heard but I was frozen. It was so real, my bedroom and everything. Real enough that I think it might've been an actual nocturnal seizure and not just a dream.

I often have dreams that I'm standing in a large group of people and then start to get dizzy and feel faint (I think the fact that it happened in front of so many people is a big reason why it is so hard on me emotionally).

One time I was in the skyway on my way back to work from a skyway convenience store (I'm in Minneapolis so the skyways are nice this time of year), but I had an aura so strong that I was 100% certain I was going to black out. I never did but I came close. I sat down on the floor of the skyway, just a 22 year old kid in a suit, temporarily deaf and nearly blind, people giving me weird looks as they walked by. All I wanted was to get away from my desk for a minute and get a muffin but now I'm the idiot on the ground shaking, clutching this muffin like it's my last hope of life. Now I'm the weirdo with stories that people went home about. I now avoid the skyways and even the thought of walking in them makes me anxious. Whenever I am walking in them I get very dizzy, but not the same kind of dizzy as the auras. Just an anxious dizzy.

Doctors won't give me any preventative medication until it they catch something on EEG (which is unlikely since this only happens every few weeks) or unless it happens again (""it"" meaning a full on grand-mal seizure - probably at the office or on the bus or in the skyway surrounded by people). I get it but I think they're kindof missing the point of preventative. Of course I can tell them stories of the auras but given that I have anxiety on my chart from years ago (who doesn't), they pass it off as panic attacks. In order to get any kind of treatment I'm going to have to have this happen again and probably get more brain damage than I already have. It's just so frustrating because it *has* happened again. Sure I haven't blacked out but I have had more seizures, they were just smaller, but they could turn into a big one at any time.

The worst part of it all isn't even the seizures, it's the fear of them. I don't want to go anywhere or talk to anyone because I could just black out at any moment or sit on the ground looking like a fool because I'm so dizzy and I can't see or hear. I don't want to be a disruption. I'm an architectural designer so social interaction and large groups are impossible to avoid.

I still don't know how I got that job. I interviewed for it after the big seizure. I have a portfolio website and had applied for nearly 20 firms in Minneapolis. Some had gotten back but not offering any kind of job. Then one day I have one of the biggest firms in the country (in the world, actually, it's an international firm) reaching out to *me* because they liked my stuff that they saw online. So that was cool. I was so dissociated however that I barely remember my interview.

It's to the point where I want it to happen again so that I can get treatment. If I'm on something at least I know I'm a little safer from it happening again. It's all I can think about whatever I'm doing. ""What if I have a seizure right now?"" I can't sleep at night so I have to take ambien which is starting not to work (and also down-regulating my GABA receptors even more, making me possibly more prone to seizures).

I used to love going to church and seeing my friends. Even just the thought of the building makes me nauseous now. I won't go anymore. When the aura happened and I was going to sit down I put my hand out. That image of my hand moving toward the grass is always in my mind like an annoying desktop wallpaper that I can't change.

My wife think's I'm being over dramatic. And honestly I agree, but I can't really help it. She has never been supportive of me in this, though. She doesn't really see what the big deal is. She also has Borderline Personality so I think that's part of her apathy. Her and I don't get along as well as I think a married couple should, and while I'll admit that I'm not perfect either I think her BPD, her constant moping, her only wanting to be a couple when it's convenient for her is the reason it's not working. But I digress.

I don't know where to turn anymore. Psychiatry can only get me so far. I've tried a few therapists but it wasn't for me (probably because in the back of my mind I know I can't cognitive-behavioral-therapy my way out of seizures). General practitioners tell me to see neurologists, neurologists tell me to see epileptologists, and epileptologists tell me to wait for it to happen again. Which it will.

If it was just seizures I think mentally it would be fine, but I know that the next one will probably come with more starving my brain of oxygen, which leads to more vision issues, more balance issues, more vertigo, more personality changes, and more seizures. But at the same time I feel like kindof a bitch because six minutes isn't even that long for a seizure, some people have had much longer ones and walked away.

I'm worried about brain damage, I'm worried about it happening in the skyway or a room full of people, except I don't know any of them. The fact that there would be a crowd of strangers would make me that much more alone.

I don't know where to turn anymore. Maybe I'm fine, maybe I just have a little PTSD.

TLDR: Had an unprovoked seizure in front of a bunch of people, went too long without air and got brain damage. Constantly terrified of it happening again and doctors aren't too keen on prevention of another one (even though there have been other ones, just smaller, and without losing consciousness, so it doesn't matter to them). Living every day not sure when I'm going to collapse and wake up more screwed up than I am already."
How do you deal with a major trigger you know is coming? (medical cw),"I feel bad even asking this, but it's starting to become a bit of an issue.

My boyfriend is having an operation in about a month. It's not anything dangerous, in fact we're both happy that he's having this operation after years of wanting it. I'm planning to travel to see him (we live in different countries), and be there for his operation and recovery. 

However, I'm getting super scared. I was in an incident ten years ago and I've been dealing with PTSD ever since, not just because of the traumatic nature of the incident, but because of the operation I had to go through and the extended hospital stay. Hospitals terrify me, and the idea of anyone I care for going through any sort of operation brings up a lot of pain. 

I'm just feeling really scared and it's been exhausting. I've been working on it with my therapist but I'm not finding that helps. Any potential tips would be appreciated, thank you."
I want hypoarousal so badly right now.,"Why does it only occur when you don't want it? My hyperarousal is triggered by rejection, adandonment, and being called things that put me in the category of abusive. 

Hypoarousal gets triggered by financial stress, being maiciously confronted, or in dangerous situations. 

I wish I could switch the two and I'm sorry to bitch but I don't like this at all."
Trigger: being called by my own name,"I know this must sound super weird and like... wtf? Ever since I was a child everyone called me Evita but my birth name is Eva. So like in normal interactions everyone would call me by my regular name but if I had done something bad or my parents were angry at me they would call me   Eva, especially my dad. It’s also something my abusive ex used to manipulate me. So every time I hear the sound of my birth name I just instantly get a sinking feeling and freeze in fear, which is really bad in some formal settings."
Best medication for PTSD anxiety?,"I have daily anxiety as a result of PTSD I was on citalopram for four years and it worked perfectly but then after having to stop it due to pregnancy and then going back on it it stopped working. My doctors keep recommending depression/anxiety medication even though every psychiatrist and psychologist has said I dont have depression its purely PTSD anxiety, whats the best PTSD Anxiety you have used? looking for recommendations, thanks in advance"
anyone else not able to 'comprehend' porn or naked bodies,"i've been sexually abused in the past three times and i never really had any sexual desires, could easily pass as asexual, and anything about sex just makes me really uncomfortable or outright frightened. when i see a clip of porn or naked bodies in general my brain does this weird thing where it can't make sense of how the body parts allign and i sort of dissociate completely, feeling like i'm in a nightmarish fog and humans start to look like apes to me and i become aware of my own body and feel myself hyper ventilating because i'm so aware that i'm this body and i'm going to die and decompose one day and so much stuff like that just spirals in my mind it's just all weird to me. and when i see male hands grabbing the woman's waist i just feel nauseous and threatened. okay i just wanted to know if anyone else feels that way. also whenever that happens my mind feels stuffy and like i just went down the IQ ladder half way at least."
"My trigger - the phrase ""need to talk"".",
I'm writing down my trauma today. Has anyone else done this?,My therapist suggested I write down everything I remembered so that's what I'm doing. I'll recite it to her during our next session. I'm mentally preparing for it but I don't think I'm ready to say it out loud. Writing is easier because I can pretend it's not real.
Is it possible to heal PTSD?,"A little bit about myself first... at the age of 16 i almost died in a car accident by myself, at 25 i got hit by a family van at 45km/hr on the street. and at the age of 27 i got in another car accident at 70km/hr.   
So yes I've got some serious trauma and all my life i asked myself one question. how can i be happy in my whole being naturally like a baby does? 

  
and I've went through an amazing journey to discover really deep fundamental of life. I've always been a positive and resilient guy and that helped me a lot in my life.

  
but i wanted to create my dreams and one of dreams was to be happy again in my body. i knew that for that to happen i had to find a way to heal these past trauma.

  
My goal was, how can i be able to think and relieve a trauma and be free from the emotional baggage of it because i knew that your life is the reflection of what's inside of you.

  
So here's the step by steps way to do this. warning! trauma can take a while to heal but if you stay consistent with this you will see a really big difference over time and it can be rough to go through this but it is worth it.

  
so the first step is to think about the trauma and then really focus on your whole being (emotions, mental, physical and energical patterns) when you think about the trauma.

  
feel the feelings related to the trauma scale them from 1 to 10, 10 meaning it's the worst feeling ever.now take your two hands in front of you and do this. imagine all these feelings, these beliefs etc... imagine them going into your hands and push them into the universe take a breath wait couple of seconds. 

  
**it doesn't matter if you don't believe it will work. DO IT! for the sake of your happiness!!!**

  
then refocus on the trauma and see how you feel NOW thinking about the same trauma. 

  
scale on 1-10 again (sometimes you can feel the emotions spiking up it is alright just continue this process.)

  
see how you feel thinking about it and do it again

  
so see the trauma, see how it makes your body react, scale it, put it into your hands, send it to universe, take couple of breath. verify how you feel again.  
RINSE and repeat.

  
Did it work for you? if not comment below i'll help you.

was anyone else bullied by nerds or was that just my experience?,"I was in a class filled with mostly nerds who loved studying and read and talk science fiction. i never cared about any of that, i cared more about clothes and being cool so i would hang out with the older kids but whenever i couldn't see them the nerds would draw a circle around me, call me names and pit my teachers against me, it even went that far that they'd call me a slut, snap my bra on my shoulder, throw sharp objects at my butt and one time when i went to the bathroom there was a few people from my class assembled in front of it and they followed me inside and tried to pull my clothes off. i always tried to tell teachers and my parents about it but they never took it serious because i had my own group of friends with who i went out with so they couldn't really grasp the concept of me having a hard time at school? idk it was some weird shit anyways

edit: also at some point another girl like me came into our class but she hung out mostly with the guys in that class meanwhile the girls would come at her left and right, she usually looked like she was near tears in class"
Back down the rabbit hole *trigger warning*,Few months ago I got myself into a situation with an addict that triggered really every aspect of my childhood. Even got arrested on my birthday in my apartment. My window broke and there was glass everywhere. Blood everywhere because he fought them. My place was TRASHED.  Triggered me. Cops ruined my birthday party once as a child and just everything about the situation sent me into this spiral of childhood memories and constant anger. I'm angry at myself for letting myself get caught up with someone who I knew would fuck me right up. I'm mad that everytime I come home I have a panic attack. I relive that night everytime I come home. I'm moving when my lease agreement goes up. Summer time can't come soon enough. I'm in this constant nightmare. I hate it.
Tying not to sound like the person who can’t get over their ex while explaining trauma/triggers to current BF,"I (F26) have been with my current boyfriend for over four years. I love him as he has always been a source of love and support. I know that I should be able to tell him anything and I want to be able to come to him with what my triggers are, however I feel like I would just always be bringing up an old relationship. He knows I have had bad relationships before and is understanding of my actions, but I don’t want to do him a disservice by being guarded when he has never given me a reason to doubt him. Does anyone have any experience or advice on how to deal with these feelings? Will I always be worried?"
Is worth fighting?,"Is it worth it to keep fighting even though everyday stuff is more than you can handle on most days, such as getting dressed, cleaning, going to the store, etc. Is it still worth it when simple social interaction can you leave drained and at times paranoid? Is it worth even getting a job and keeping it is beyond your level of functioning? Is it worth ? Or do I just need to suck it up and just do it regardless of what it does to me mentally or physically? .... mindless ramblings"
Confused,"Not really sure how this works yet, it was recommened to me. I've been told a lot of thing that make it hard for me to go to someone I know. I hope I can find some sort of escape on here"
My is Having a Dinner Party and I Really Don’t want to See the People Around My Age,"They were all bystanders to my bullying (trauma) on the schoolbus, and I’m just uncomfortable because of that fact."
I still don't know if I can call it emotional abuse (SUICIDE TW),"When I was 14, my best friend (who happens to be an online friend) told me she'd attempted suicide a few weeks prior. I went numb as I talked to her about it. Then I cried to my mum. Then I went numb again. I remember going to school and not feeling like anything was real.  
 

Trigger warning for anger at suicide from here.

And then I felt angry. I have never felt so angry in my life. I was not an angry person before that day. But it was like I became a new person.   
 

I did not know how to release this anger. I couldn't talk to my parents because I knew they'd just ban me from the Internet. So I found a website for depression, with a section marked off for friends and family of depressed people. I talked about how very, very angry I felt. About how her mum would feel if she died. About how I felt she had lied to me because she once promised she would go to a hospital if she ever attempted suicide, and she broke that promise. About how I felt I could no longer trust her. About how she never told an adult about her suicide attempt, only her friends. About how I wanted to call the police (which looking back I actually meant ambulance but my head was muddled) because I didn't know what to do. About how I obsessively checked her online activity to ensure she was still alive. About how I felt suicide was selfish but I could see why others disagreed. About how she had once said suicide was cowardly so I didn't understand how she could go and do it herself. About how i felt like shaking her for not realizing her death would ruin everyone around her. About how I didn't know who else to speak to. About how, due to my own experiences with my grandmother who had died recently and had severe severe severe depression but refused help for it, I struggled with anger towards people with depression. About how pleased I was with the Christmas present I bought for her and that I wanted to give it to her in hospital, but that I had a cold and couldn't go see her. About how she died two days later and I felt guilty that i never got to see her on Christmas because I was ill. About how from my perspective my family was just leaving her to lying in bed all day because she refused help so much (years later I discussed this with my parents and they explained that they did help her very much, but she did not want to see them and they did not want to violate her privacy. I did not see how much they helped her and fought for her to be hospitalized so she could receive treatment because they tried to protect me from what was happening. They knew seeing her scared me and so they tried to protect me. I only overheard their frustration within my own home.)
 

Over the course of the next few days, I was told by the grown adults on the website that I was dangerous to be around mentally ill people, that my words made them cry, that since I had not used a trigger warning I clearly did not care who I hurt with my words (I mistakenly believed having ""my friend attempted suicide"" in the title would serve as a trigger warning itself) and that the only reason i had any sense or compassion was that I had not told my friend how I felt. Only one person stood up for me and was ignored by all the other users. They verbally acknowledged that I sounded young. They said these things to me anyway. I did not sleep well whilst this happened. It was Easter but I had no appetite. I cried in bed. I cried in the toilets of a restaurant. I asked them politely to take my post down because I didn't want it up any more. They said that they would discuss it. Then they changed their minds and said that for the sake of battling mental health stigma, my post would remain up. Then they locked it. My post, and everything afterwards, stayed up for two and a half years. They only removed it when my counsellor got on their case.  
 

I am now 20. I have been coping with PTSD symptoms from my friends suicide attempt ever since.  
 

I do not blame my friend for the loss of a happy adolescence. I blame the people on that website. The moderator used to work with special needs students. The moment I read that, I felt utterly and completely terrified for those students because she clearly has, or had, no idea how to deal with traumatized children. She clearly had no idea how to help an angry child without resorting to shaming them for that anger. It absolutely terrifies me that she was around them. I get panicky when I hear someone else with her name; I imagine hiding under a table if I ever happen to meet her.   
 

The things she said, or allowed people to say to me when I was traumatized and vulnerable, have given me a skewed perspective on anger. My anger is always followed by guilt. I once confronted an adult woman who had been engaging in illegal acts with a teenager. I was furious with her because she had lied to me about what had happened and tried to act as if the teenager was to blame. I ended up crying, having a panic attack, and suicidal because I expressed that anger. I did not know how to cope with an emotion that, at 14 years old, I had been told was wrong to feel.   
 

I highly doubt the people (read: grown adults who should have known better than to treat a 14 year old that way) are assholes. In fact I'm certain they are good people who deserve lots of good things. But they were assholes to me.   
 

Because I no longer feel guilty for saying that I thought suicide was selfish. I no longer feel guilty for saying I wanted to shake her. Because you cannot expect a 14 year old to fully understand suicide. You cannot expect a 14 year old to handle their friends suicide attempt, whilst receiving no support, perfectly.   
 

Because you know what? I handled talking to my friend pretty fucking well. I never let on how angry I was until years after the event. I never told her what had happened with the website until years after the event. I spent hours researching depression and suicide to try and help her. I was careful which of our mutual friends I told about her attempt, because it was such a private matter that I didn't want to blab to someone whom she didn't want knowing about it. I contacted one of her friends to create a suicide plan for if she ever attempts again. I sent her links to support websites. Whenever we didn't talk for a day, I would obsessively check her online accounts to check she was still alive. And I did all of that whilst getting triggered into flashbacks every single fucking time.  
 

So to the adults on that website: I'm not scared of you anymore. Because I know I did nothing wrong. Talking about how angry you feel about a traumatic event is not wrong. I was not wrong for being a child who did not fully understand suicide. You were the adults. You could have acted like it. Instead, you made the choice to shove all of your own pain and suffering onto a already vulnerable child, and you sat there behind your laptops, and you told her it was her own fault. Did you know that there were Childline counsellors who sounded absolutely horrified at what you said to me? Did you know that one Childline counsellor even suggested I make a formal complaint against you? I said no at the time. I did not want to upset you. Now I wish I had because given the trauma you have caused, I fucking deserved to make that fucking complaint.  
 

I'm not a scared, guilty, self-loathing 14 year old anymore. I am an adult who can stand up for myself. And more importantly, I am an adult who can stand up for children. The angry children. The ""bad"" children. The children who express feelings that others don't like. I will stand up for those children, because unlike you, I will make the choice not to kick them whilst they're down.  
 

And yet I still don't know if I can call what happened to me emotional abuse."
Living behind a glass wall,"I look at my friends relationships, and I can’t help but be envious. My boyfriend and I have great times staying in and doing things at home due to my ptsd and other diagnoses. Our relationship is beautiful and flourishes everyday. 

I wish I could be more for him. I wish I could get up and taking him hiking, take him dancing, take him to eat, travel, make new friends together. I wish I could do all these things. 

I feel bad about who I am. I want to be fun. I want to have fun. I want to live new experiences and love new people with him. 

A combination of the PTSD and my borderline personality disorder leave me stuck behind a glass wall, watching others display beautiful lives of adventure and vulnerability. I’ve tried to break the glass, but I bleed, and I scar, and I crawl back behind my safety net and continue watching like a fly on the wall that has been smushed and forgotten."
War Damage - Bringing The Battle Home - PTSD,"Ted is a friend of mine and has firsthand knowledge of the long term effects of PTS (PTSD). He writes about his experience putting an emphasis on the effects on families, marriages, co-workers, etc. I'm not a vet, but was really shocked from what I learned about PTSD and thought the least I could do is support his book and the many vets out there that may benefit from it. Thanks Here is a link to his book.

I really feel that I need to talk about my traumatic event again.,"Um.. so I believe and my psychiatrist thinks that PTSD from school bullying is rare.. and I’m trying not to talk about it specially when it’s hurts and after few hours I’m having a panic attack and the next day I’m stressed and having anxiety from school and trying not to panic again.
So here I’m going to blame myself: maybe I was young but I don’t needed to believe this girl she manipulated me and used fake stuff to make my class hate me and bullied for four years everyday, it’s my fault for forgiving them it’s my fault for talking with them it’s my fault to say hello to her when she moved to my school.
when I remember that they wanted to drown me and choke me and they only was 10 so I am, I feel how they put hands on my throat and wanted to choke me but I broke the manipulative bully arm and ran away.
I had low grades because of it, my parents thought I just don’t want to study and move school for being unnoticed by teachers.
The teachers also thought that but they thought I’m out of reality ""somewhere in space"", THEY SEEN ME CRY but they never done something about it.
But they noticed that I’m alone all the time so they sent me three times a week to therapy and said I have depression and I’m not diagnosed by an actual professional, I was depressed I knew it.
I really want to break something but nvm.
I saw my horrible bully on a bus I remembered what she done for me and I wanted hurt her but I knew it’s not ok.
I’m dealing with it by talking about it.
My ptsd result: social anxiety, panic attacks, passive aggressive behavior. 
It’s hard to have friends for me I even don’t remember what a friend is lol."
EMDR and complex PTSD,"EMDR has been recommended to me by my therapist, so I can reprocess the trauma I experienced. But, I don’t remember key events. The trauma I went through happened over years. I have forgotten several years of my life. How can I reprocess my trauma if I don’t remember everything? Can complex ptsd really be reprocessed through EMDR?"
My abuser called yesterday.,"Yesterday my father called me for the first time in 5 years. He sexually abused me as a child for 4 years I left when I was 12-13.  I was driving with my mom to pick up my aunt. She had a missed call from South Carolina, where my dad is from and lives? I didn't even recognize his voice at first, I removed so much of him from my memory even now I don't remember exactly how his face looks. He asked how I was what my grades were in school. If I was graduating high school this year. Five years and he calls as if absolutely nothing happened. He abused me for years before I left him, and that's what he talks about. I'm driving this whole time trying not to cry, crash, scream, or kill myself. All while suddenly facing my abuser. He told me that he loves me and that he wants a relationship with me. I don't know what to do; he's trying to buy me off with a graduation gift of a computer and probably a lot more. But I don't know how I feel I've been shut down and floating in a bog. I know I'm running from my emotions but I don't know if I can face anything. I'm scared and today was spent trying not to fall apart in school. Hoping that I didn't look as destroyed as I feel that my eyes had some life in them. That I wasn't as broken as I felt. That I could come back from such a feeling. I talked to my friends, and I laughed, but it feels like five years' worth of progress disappeared overnight. What do I even do next? This sucks so badly."
Depression? PTSD? I don't even know...,"Hi, guys. I've had depression since I was 12 and PTSD for 4 years. I've been through a lot of shit. But of late, my PTSD and depression has been so intertwined, that it's becoming increasingly difficult to separate the two. Anyways, I had about two weeks that were... normal. And by normal, I mean that I was happy. I barely had any depression (just a little), and the PTSD was ""quiet."" Not even really a white noise, ""it's in the background but there"" kind of feeling, if that makes sense. I felt like I could deal with life. But today has been weird, and I'm wondering if anyone has felt like this or knows what it is? I'm not happy, but I don't feel (mostly) depressed. And I'm not dealing with PTSD stuff. I'm missing some people who aren't in my life or who across the country... I feel like I should be happy, but I'm not excited about anything and am just tired of existing. I'm not suicidally depressed.... just... tired of existing and I don't want to anymore. (I'm NOT suicidal!) It's a weird feeling."
CPTSD vs GAD,"What’s the general thought in differences between the two? Most significantly, does the treatment and way to see oneself change.   I personally go through bouts of impending doom and extreme anxiety but feel it’s mostly related to childhood trauma that’s been compounded by a traumatic event/s 2 years ago. I am currently in IFS therapy and curious thoughts.  Some close to me suggested taking lexapro or an anti-anxiety but I wonder if there’s other things to do beforehand?  Personally, I’ve found EMDR to be hokey and didn’t feel anything but sadness and depression constantly going to the past."
Weight loss,"Anyone else struggle with losing weight. Food is a coping mechanism for me. I also am afraid of advances from the opposite sex. The most common suffering of my PTSD has been caused by girls in school, and reinforced by women in the workplace. I am afraid of being used for a sick joke, and I am also afraid of another grown woman lying to get me in trouble. I am afraid if I accept the advances of the wrong woman, I will suffer greatly, and maybe even be driven to suicide. I fear if I reject the wrong woman, she will lie to the authorities, and I will be thrown in jail. I live in fear."
Ongoing Trauma,I have PTSD from being assaulted and stalked. My stalker is still out there trying to find me. It’s been going on for 8 years. How can I get even begin to heal if the threat is STILL HERE?
Not getting over it.,"Long time lurker here - I've been wanting to get this off of my chest for a  while.

I'll try to make this short and sweet - sometimes I feel bad for not wanting to get over my trauma. As fucked as that sounds, sometimes I just don't want to get over it at all. I'm terrified of doing so. But I'm scared that if I do, I'll lose all sense of myself.

Who will I be without this? I don't even want to find out. I don't even want to know. 

It feels so cruel to want. I don't want to get over it all the time because I'm just scared of who I'll be afterwards. My trauma made me into who I am today. I still have constant nightmares, I still have flashbacks. My heart races at certain mentions, and I cry whenever I hear certain names. 

I want to get better at managing my symptoms, but I don't want to completely grow past my trauma..."
TRIGGER WARNING,"I would  like to share something I wrote...

This is not YOUR PTSD…This is MINE

Although you may not “GET it”…
 It’s still there.
No I can’t just get over it!
 No I can’t JUST let it go!
 WHY don’t you see? 
Sometimes it is in the form of an ALL encompassing, body and mind weary, heart thudding, suffocating FEAR. Or it is the days when I can’t get out of bed, not to shower, brush my teeth, or to FUNCTION.
The days when the blackness of depression takes over this once light and joyful spirit. 
The days when I have a snake like thing crawling in my stomach, the heaviness and bewilderment of trying. TRYING OH SO HARD!! To make logical sense of what my brain and body are doing. 
The days when I am embarrassed to cry, start to feel crazy in my head, the ANGER and INJUSTICE of not being able to UNDERSTAND myself! The days when I want to give up! The days when I do NOT see the LIGHT, The days when I reach out to people and am met with embarrassment, pity, scorn, derogatory comments, lack of understanding or just plain ignorance. All the while I am battling the very same voices in my head who are YELLING the same things!! 
The days when all I can do is sleep them away, waking to dark circles, feelings of doom, helpless, hopeless, and achingly bone crushing tiredness. 
The days when I am afraid to be happy because that feeling of DOOM has put my mind and body on HIGH ALERT. The days when  triggers are constant, loud, overwhelmingly THERE.  The days when I put that mask of fake happy-everything-is ok- in- my-world FACE. The days when I give everything I’ve got to make MYSELF believe that SOMEHOW it will SOMEDAY all BE OK! 
The days when I feel so alone, lonely, confused, scared, scarred and used up. 
The days when I feel that I can’t DO IT ANYMORE. 

No ….
This is not YOUR PTSD…This is MINE

S.Krushinsky"
I was just diagnosed yesterday with ptsd from years and years of child abuse and sexual abuse. My parents trigger it the worst but won’t leave me alone,"Things kept getting worse for me since fall. Panic attacks and anxiety attacks are occurring more often, my nightmares won’t stop, I can’t shut my brain off, intrusive thoughts are getting gruesome, etc. so I finally got professional help. I didn’t think I had ptsd, I thought I could just talk to someone and feel better. That didn’t happen. My parents deny anything happened to me. They allowed me to sexually abused from the age of 6 to 16 by 4 different people. They physically abused me until 18 and emotionally abused me until last year. I cut them off last spring and my father has been continuing to try and “make peace” with me. I have tried time and time again to make things work. I had confronted them at least seven different times and each time they refuse to acknowledge anything I’m saying. They either act like it’s their first time hearing it or they blame me. I stayed in contact with them for so long only because I was afraid. I’m afraid my father is going to hurt me or my child. I jump at every sound I hear, I don’t trust anyone. They have given my number to people who call and tell me I have to talk to them and my father said he’s gonna show up at my house to see why I won’t talk to him. I live started away but he still knows where I live and it’s terrifying to think I will have to actually see him. I completely shut down once I hear his voice or my mothers voice. I have called the police but they can’t do much unless they actually make a threat so I could only create a paper trail. I’m so scared."
I'm in a dv shelter inpatient is free my ptsd is flaring up feel hopeless,Never been hospitalized but this blows I'm so depressed does it help or hurt I'm tired of seeing happy dv victims I just sleep all day every day
"I'm at a loss for words, but Ill try to explain","My trauma comes from emotional abuse and neglect I suffered, primarily at the hands of my father, who has since passed away. Before he died, however, just seeing his picture or hearing his voice was enough to trigger me. This is where my little brother comes in...

I love my brother, he's absolutely nothing like my father was; he's smart, he's a good kid, I love that I can have such a good relationship with him, be his friend and a positive male influence he wouldn't have gotten elsewhere. But he's almost an adult now, and I just saw him on video chat after a few months of not seeing him in person, and...he's starting to look like and sound like my father, almost a spitting image. 

I suspected this might be the case, since pictures of my father as a child are a dead ringer for him, but I didn't expect it to have this effect on me. It wasn't my father in any sense of the word, but just seeing my brother's face and hearing his voice absolutely trending towards that resemblance, was enough for me to be overcome with a sense of dread and panic. 

I feel a million different things right now and am just totally at a loss of what to think. How can I be like this? I love my little brother, I've known him all his life. Why would that be any different to me now? Has anyone else had to deal with this?"
TW Why am I still thinking about it? TW,"So, my dad has (until recently) always been the type of parent who would rather spank their child than actually discipline them. So when I was eight, my older brother and I got in an argument while cleaning our room. (My brothers and I shared the room) One thing I remember vividly is that my brother got a ""don't pick on your brother."" For me, my dad took his belt, bent me over his knee, and started swinging. He kept going. And going. My sister and Mom were screaming at him to stop. And he kept going. I don't even remember him stopping. I just remember being in bed in my room, and my mom came in and told me to stop crying, then she left. My dad came in a few minutes later, screaming at me to shut up, or he would ""give me something to cry about."" So I took something, it was either a sock or a washcloth, and put it in my mouth to muffle the sound, and quietly cried myself to sleep. My dad and I have a decent relationship now. He acknowledges his mistakes, and is genuinely trying to be better, and I'm trying to forgive him for this, and other verbal abuse incidents. The problem is, anyone can do the smallest thing that reminds me of him, and I panic. I hyperventilate, tears come, but I try not to make sound, because I'm terrified all over again if I do. I start picturing what he did. I see a belt, and the same thing happens. I visibly flinch when people do that thing to snap the sides of the belt together. A little while ago, my little brother was procrastinating cleaning, so he took off his belt, and put it on the doorknob as ""a reminder of what will happen if you don't start working."" And I had to go to the bathroom to calm down. Now, he know about my anxiety, and if I have a panic attack, he'll ask what's wrong and try to calm me down, but I don't trust it. I don't trust him. I'll be quiet. I hardly even breathe when he's near, because I don't know if he'll react to me hyperventilating. What do I do? How do I stop this? 
Tl;Dr sorry I can't sum this up in a tldr."
Being “nice”,"I understand it is obvious to most people that being nice is generally preferable. 

I think partially it is genuine kindness. However, it is often also, and sometimes exclusively, purely to get their needs met (for validation, attention, community, social norms/approval, to sleep with you, to kiss up to the boss, etc.). I’ve had difficulty with this second group of reasons. 

I have a strong desire for sincerity, in myself and others. There is almost nothing I find more distasteful than people that are nice or pleasant to manipulate people or to get what they want. I literally don’t understand it emotionally. It bothers me very much. 

Today I took a deeper dive. Why does it bother me so much when people are being fake nice or somewhere on the spectrum of manipulation? Why do I have such a visceral reaction to social quid pro quo’s? 

I realized it’s partially because it scares me. A lot. I say what I mean and I mean what I say. Therefore I assume that people are telling the truth all the time and don’t have ulterior motives. 

Life has shown me over and over that this is not true. Sometimes in breathtakingly cruel ways. 

So I’m scared. I’m scared because I apparently can’t tell when people are lying. And worse, when I get a gut feeling or indication (or even proof hitting me in the head over and over) that someone is not being truthful, I try so hard not to believe it. The mental gymnastics I’ve gone through to believe people are just... pathological, almost. They have brought great harm to me. 

Sorry for the long post, but back to the point. 

I spent some time lurking in a gifting sub in which people were so nice. Are there scammers there, and users? Probably. *But it felt good reading there*. 

I tossed off a (what I thought was a no big deal) comment the other day in another sub, that blew up, and a lot of meanness was directed toward me. It was important for me to look at both the supportive and kind comments, and the nasty ones. But overall, *it did not feel good reading there*. 

I realized, I want to be nicer. Because it feels better. 

I don’t need a hyper-vigilant protector to call people out. 

There is a time and a place for disagreement and boundary-setting as well. *But getting angry isn’t the same thing.* I am the only one who gets upset most of the time. 

And it’s not in alignment with my values, because I spend a good portion of my time trying to help people, and that’s deeply important to me.

I guess this might not help anyone. But it’s helping me. Paying attention to these reactions is helping. Maybe there are others who have similar thoughts/feelings/reactions (anger toward fake-nice, lying, manipulative, and/or disingenuous behavior). 

A couple of other thoughts. I spend a lot of time being kind, I just have an issue with perceived disingenuous or shitty behavior, cloaked in a “nice person” facade. I am quick to anger in those circumstances. 

I can’t *stand* it when people laugh at all the bosses jokes, but don’t make eye contact with the janitor taking out their trash. I’m the “weirdo” who talks to the janitor, because I actually, truly, deeply believe they have equal inherent value. 

I think it’s extremely gross when people interact with others purely for what they can get out of the relationship. 

I don’t talk to people as means to an end. I don’t use people. Those are my values. And that part won’t change. 

I just need to keep paying attention and try to be more discerning about setting boundaries for myself, and trusting my gut about people and situations. And I need to accept not everyone shares my values.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. 

TL;DR- I realized being nice is a better idea for my own healing, and that there are more effective ways to protect myself than calling people out or getting angry."

Study conducted during war finds one symptom that is especially indicative of PTSD vulnerability,">The researchers found that showing the startle response was clearly the most important predictor of future PTSD symptoms. Reduced emotion, blame, negative emotions and an avoidance of thoughts relating to the conflict were also, in order of decreasing importance, predictive of future symptoms. Participants who showed any of these five symptoms earlier in the study (but the startle response, especially) were more likely to show even more PTSD-related symptoms later on – and those who had more of these predictive symptoms early on developed even more of the other symptoms of PTSD over time.

>The researchers believe this means these are the specific symptoms that could indicate PTSD vulnerability and that targeting them early on could have a preventative benefit.

"After having PTSD for over a year, I finally having the diagnosis in writing.","Somehow, after struggling with this shit for 14+ months, I never got a direct diagnosis.

Sure, I was validated by therapists when they referred to the assholes as ""abusers"" and my experiences as ""trauma,"" but never have I seen clearly in writing that I have PTSD.

Not only is it in writing, my therapist marked my condition as ""severe."" She wrote, ""\[AbsurdPigment\] experiences symptoms of PTSD, including: disassociation, flashbacks, panic, insomnia and hypervigilance on a daily basis. **Any social setting** can trigger these. \[AP\] could isolate herself, avoid others, become unable to attend class if symptoms are not managed.""  


I know this. And I know some stuff she missed (like I am triggered when I'm alone too lmao), and some stuff she may have put too much emphasis on (my hypervigilance isn't as intense as most). **But now it is in writing.**

After a full year. After a year of my parents calling it ""panic moments,"" asking me if it is because I didn't eat enough grains. After being told it was me directing my general anxiety at certain events so I can use those events as my scapegoat. Being told that I use the word ""trauma"" too much as a patient from my therapist. Being told by a therapist to wait to process my trauma until the school year was done (can you believe that? Yeah, sure, I'll just tuck these flashbacks into my back pocket for a rainy day. wtf). A year of therapists not saying PTSD but rather saying ""your ptsd-like symptoms.""

This makes me want to cry. This is the best therapist I've ever had because she actually listens and emphasizes. She's the only one who opened up the conversation to my upbringing, to find where the pattern of trauma started so we can break it. She is the only one who listened to me about my OCD. I love her. And I feel a huge weight off my shoulders knowing that someone else with the credentials believes me. I'm all anxious with this surge of emotions now haha oh man."
It becomes more real after you’re evaluated,"I was diagnosed with the following:

Occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.
* Depressed mood
* Suicidal ideation 
* Disturbance of motivation and mood
* Anxiety 
* Difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships 
* Chronic sleep impairment 
*PTSD

Nightmares affecting sleep,"Posting for a friend. (I hope this is the right subreddit for this.) I'd like to understand a little better what she might be going through and any suggestions on things that might help her.

Brief background. She's an adult now, but was physically and sexually abused by multiple family members from roughly ages 4-9. She has almost nightly nightmares of the abuse. Previously they have been of the family member, but the past week it's been ""strangers"". 

Is there anything that someone would suggest that might help her get some sleep? She barely manages a few, unrestful hours.

As a note, I'm know that I'm not any sort of replacement for a professional, and she knows that I recommend she find one. Just looking for some insight, and possibly something that might help a little.

Tl;dr Friend has persistent nightmares of past abuse. Wondering if there is anything that can help her sleep."
how do you explain gaps in your employment history? do you disclose your ptsd to employers?,"basically the title.

i'm in the process of going back to work after essentially a year+ off, due to recovery. the gap in my resume will inevitably be discussed, and i'm curious of how i should approach that.

do you tell your employers about your ptsd? i do have an official diagnosis, if that matters. 

thanks in advance!"
My first triggered panic attack happened on Christmas,"It was all fun and dandy. My whole family sat there by the table, we were talking, laughing, till one of my sisters mentioned how one time police came to my house at night and how I'm a troublemaker.

My parents told the family that I was a witness in shoplifting. They lied to save our reputation. It all happened last year. The truth is, my friend staged an intervention as I was about to commit suicide and he wouldn't be able to help me as he lived far away. So he called the police, and thinking about it now, rightfully so.

I turned it all around. Claimed it was a mistake, I didn't take anything, look at my wrists! Not a single cut! I'm not suicidal at all! It must be a misunderstanding, I looove life. All the bullshit that had to be said. 

They believed me. My parents were pissed at my friend calling the cops on us at midnight. I couldn't talk to him anymore, had to cut all ties. It hurt, he wanted to save my life and he actually did as my parents checked on my every couple minutes each day from then on. I went to a psychiatrist without them knowing. I got on meds. I'll be starting therapy soon. It all turned around thanks to a friend that probably won't even talk to me anymore.

That's it, I just wanted to share my story. I was diagnosed with PTSD, but nothing ever triggered it. Now I know it's a long road till I fully recover from all the things that happened to me, not just that intervention. Thank you for reading my post."
Too prepared?,"I have a friend who is, as far as I'm aware, really good at fighting and not really afraid of hurting others the way I am. And for some reason I thought it a good idea to ask him fighting tips, despite the fact that I do not expect to get into a fight anytime soon. But y'know, just in case I ever, like, get into a barfight or something like that. Is that paranoid of me? (Serious question. He said it isn't, that I'm just aware, but he also said other stuff that, quite frankly, makes me doubt his judgement in that regard)."
The first attempt to estimate in absolute numbers how many adult war survivors globally may suffer PTSD - 354 million?,">Background: Elevated prevalences of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depression (MD) have been reported in populations exposed to war. However, no global estimates of war survivors suffering from PTSD and/or MD in absolute numbers have been reported.
>
>Objective: We made the first attempt to estimate in absolute numbers how many adult war survivors globally may suffer PTSD and/or MD, which should inform local and global mental health programmes.
>
>Results: We estimate that about 1.45 billion individuals worldwide have experienced war between 1989 and 2015 and were still alive in 2015, including one billion adults. On the basis of our meta-analysis, we estimate that about 354 million adult war survivors suffer from PTSD and/or MD. Of these, about 117 million suffer from comorbid PTSD and MD.

Therapy and psychiatric appointments f*ck me up and interfere with my ability to work,"I have no idea why, because my mental health has improved otherwise and I have significantly more energy than before. Also mood wise I'm mostly fine now to the point where other people notice. 
But as soon as I'm confronted with my ""issues"" I fall into this deep dark pit again and need a several days to recover. 

I'm toying with the thought of ending therapy or maybe just taking a break at this point, because I have discovered so many other ways to make me feel better which I can't do when therapy drains my energy that much. 

I don't think it's because of what I'm talking about in  therapy but more the fact that I am in therapy, if you know what I mean?

"I don’t know if I’m right to feel the way I feel, or if it’s PTSD making me feel that way.","First post ever, long time lurker. 

I have PTSD from an abusive relationship I had when I was a teenager (sexual, emotional and physical). I have a boyfriend now, and he’s the father of my child.  

We fight  about my PTSD sometimes, particularly me saying “these are triggers, please don’t do this”. He does these triggering things anyways and just says “oh it’s too hard to remember all your triggers”.  I even made him a list before to help him remember but he just doesn’t. 

Well the night before last was a rough night for me PTSD wise. Lots of flashbacks and hyper vigilance. He wanted to know what was going on with me so I texted him back and told him I was having a rough night, flashbacks etc. 

He texted me back “you drain the fucking life out of me it’s so exhausting to be there for you sometimes”. That just sent me spiraling more. 

I know in my heart what he does isn’t right but he tells me it’s just the PTSD. Like I know being with someone with PTSD can be exhausting, I get it. But I don’t think it’s right to tell them that in the middle of a flashback.

Am I wrong? Like he’s entitled to feel how he feels but is it really appropriate to say that when he said it? I’m so fucking hurt and confused. I’m tired. I feel broken. I just want to be normal."
Rough Night,"I had a shitty night, I had nightmares and woke up almost in a panic attack and once I managed to calm myself down I was paranoid and I thought somebody was looking in my window at night, so once I woke up which was around 2 am I stayed awake until I thought the imaginary person at my window was gone. I thought that if I went back to sleep the man at my window would come in and kill me. Is there any medication for nightmares? I’ve tried Trazodone and I’m off it now because I was taking such a huge dose of it to work, now I’m on seroquel."
I'm in so much pain.,"TRIGGER WARNING: self harm.

Has anyone ever felt this pain? It's not physical pain and yet it is. Its agony and anguish and you just feel it wrecking your whole body. I don't know how to explain it. It is so much emotional pain and hatred that I physically feel it.

I'm posting this, I suppose for help. I have a problem when I feel this pain, no one can see that I'm in pain so I self harm to essentially prove that I'm actually hurting so much... thankfully, so far I haven't cut myself (this time), but I have another problem... I have celiac disease and can not tolerate gluten at all, it makes my PTSD worse, I get ulcers in my mouth as a reaction, and for days I'll be doubled over in pain as my immune system attacks my digestive tract.

If you've connected the dots, I've been abusing my celiac disease, it's so easy to eat gluten, because it's in so many different, delicious foods.

I just want to feel pain. I feel like on the outside I'm timid and calm but on the inside I'm just screaming in agony, and I don't know how to show that on the outside other than harming myself. Idk what else to do. I'm in therapy and I've been fine, recently I've brought up things in my childhood, that I can't do anything about and I grew up with it being normal. 

I'm rambling but idk what to do other than open up here, my next appointment is a week away and I'm just so scared that I'm going to have a breakdown before that...

I'm sorry for this post, but thank you for reading."
The bacteria in your gut might affect your vulnerability to PTSD,">Lead author on the paper, Sian Hemmings, is based at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, where about three quarters of the population experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetime, and more than half experience multiple traumatic events. PTSD is a debilitating anxiety disorder, which can persist for years. While estimates of its prevalence in South Africa, as well as other countries, vary widely, in the US, for example, about 6.8 per cent of adults are diagnosed with PTSD at some point in their lives. There’s a pressing need for new insights into the factors that contribute to PTSD, and new strategies for prevention and treatment.
>
>Clues to the involvement of the gut microbiome in PTSD come from its role in the body’s response to infection and physical injury (the inflammatory response), which can be affected by stress. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in the normal regulation of inflammation, and lowered levels of Tregs have been found in people after they are exposed to stress in the psych lab, and in refugees with chronic PTSD, compared with controls.
>
>The researchers analysed the gut bacteria (via their faecal samples) of 30 South Africans who had experienced a traumatic event. Eighteen of them had subsequently developed PTSD and they had lower levels of three phyla of bacteria – Actinobacteria, Lentisphaerae and Verrucomicrobia – compared with those who hadn’t developed PTSD.

*TW* I still remember like it was yesterday *TW*,"January 14th marked 7 years since I was r*ped. It wasnt what everyone thinks of when they hear the word. It wasnt ""forced"". I was manipulated for a year and a half, and on january 14th, 7 years ago, I was convinced to take anxiety pills, that he was the only one who could love me and wanted to touch me, and so I let him. I thought that sex was just a requirement of love. I didnt realize I had been manipulated for months. Thankfully my parents came home early that day and caught him, otherwise I might not have ever realized what he did was wrong. I was 14, he was 19. He tricked me in so many ways. Made me feel special, convinced me I was his one and only. He used the fact that I had recently developed mental issues and wormed his way into my fragile state. He got me pregnant. He never knew, because I miscarried before the court date 3 months later. It was my first time having sex, my first time being pregnant, and my first miscarriage. At 14. I am now 21. I still have nightmares. I still can barely have sex without flashbacks. I still cringe every time I see his name. I still wince every time I see or hear someone that reminds me. And I still panic every year on that day. 
The worst part? Its not even the flashbacks anymore. Its the baby fever I get that reminds me of the baby I lost. Its the tear I wipe away every time I see my nephew or niece, the moments of sadness when I pass the baby isles in walmart. Its knowing that I had a precious thing growing inside me from such a horrible event, a beautiful star amidst all the blackness, and the stress he caused took that away too. 
But after all this, I have one thing I would like to say to you A.S.W.: 
You didn't get the best of me. 
You may have broken me then, but I am being fixed now and you will never see the woman I am becoming.
You will never know the child you lost, but you will have a stain on your soul that even you can't figure out. 
One day I will be whole again. 
One day I will go days, weeks, months, and even years without thinking of you, and I can't wait to never think of you again.
One day you will die and your soul will be weighed, and you may not have remembered me, but your gods will, and you will get what you deserve. 
So yes, some days hope gets me through, and some days its the knowledge of justice, but I am getting through and I AM DOING IT WITHOUT YOU."
Should I reach out to the HR of my former employer to let them know I developed PTSD?,"It’s been over 6 months since the incident that made me quit my job with only two days notice.

"(possible TW) Drasticizing and catastrophizing , i think thats a name for it. Anyone else struggle with this?","One of my biggest issues through out my ptsd is my mind coming up with worst case scenarios, dissociating from reality and then believing it’s real. Today i’m waiting for a package and my mind takes the wheel and imagining i answer the door for the package, and delivery man comes in holds me down, etc, i’m completely helpless home alone and no one will answer the phone, if i let my dog out of his kennel maybe he’ll bite him but he’ll get away and that’ll be a whole new problem. I try and call my fiancé to come home but he doesn’t pick up, i have to call 911 because i’ve been attacked or violated but they don’t believe me and i return to my life of perpetual shame that drives me. My fiancé is disgusted with me, tells me i’ve cheated on him and betrayed him, leaves me homeless alone and disgusted with myself, but at least finally everyone hates me so i can just off myself. I eventually come back to reality and realize none of that has happened, but it feels like it happened. It’s like a flashback of a trauma that never happened. Some may call it an emotional flashback with the scenario just being reminiscent of my past. This is why i hate being home alone ever, i’m hesitant to get my dog training (because he is a 90 lb biter), i can’t ever try and fall asleep without distraction, i really can’t do anything without distracting myself. I feel like i’m never safe and i can’t trust anyone. I’m working on getting back on my meds and i just feel hopeless today. It’s hard to validate any of my traumas when now my inner critic just likes to make up trauma that feels real.

"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them."

"""Just try harder"" - do people not realize that depression makes that really difficult?","Depression isn't just a mood. It can be physical, causing fatigue and pain. It can mess with your willpower and motivation. It's not that we're just choosing not to try, it's part of the depression."

At this point I’m not sure I exist for any other purpose than to please and assist other people. I couldn’t end it all because so many people depend on me, just for once I wish I had somebody I could depend on."

I made cookies today,I made cookies today. I haven’t done baking in years. I haven’t done anything in so long. I went out and bought ingredients and then baked them at 3am and did all the washing up and completed it and I’m actually kinda proud. I made peanut butter snickerdoodles and I’m quite happy with them
My mom died and I’m not okay,"My mom passed away 4 weeks ago today, she was 32. She was battling with addiction and this past year she was getting better, i had no doubt she would succeed because she was so strong and determined and it all came so suddenly. It’s especially difficult because I was so close to her. 

I’d get depressed at the thought of her dying because of her addiction and it became my number one fear. Now that she’s gone everything feels hopeless, i feel so alone, sad, numb and angry to the point where this feeling feels overwhelming and unbearable. I lack the motivation to do anything, everyday feels repetitive. 

I’ll never forget the morning it happened, it was a Sunday and i woke up to my step dad frantically yelling for my grandma, “She’s not waking up!” I immediately because terrified because I’ve feared hearing those words the most. The ambulance came and tried their best to save her, but concluded her heart stopped hours before. After that, I cried for hours, i wouldn’t believe and I still can’t. I have major emotional breakdowns on a daily basis and I continue to isolate myself in my room. 

I start high school this year and I feel so lost without her, terrified of the future and what’s to come, I don’t know what to do. It hurts to know even more she’ll never see me graduate, and fulfill my goals, the ones she helped me create and strive for. Admittedly I feel like I don’t wanna go on living and that thought scares me."
Hell on Earth,"Fake people. Fake leaders. Fake culture. Fake world. Empty values. The worship of fakeness. Addictive, manufactured desires. Exploitation machines mass produced and redesigned each day. Anomie. Anxiety. Alienation. Invisibility. Projections. A whole world infected by self-destructive lifestyles, yet no safe place to discuss my self-destructive feelings without being made to feel insane, silenced, made invisible, and then having all kinds of shit projected on to me.

Psychology/psychiatry, so deeply yoked to the status quo. No bridge between the world of politics and the world of psychology. No bridge between the world of science and the world of change. Only the slow growth of the capitalist machine and the few mutations toward progress that might arise in it. 

The most intelligent known being in the universe, stunting its own growth at every stage, through war, repression, oppression, hegemony, manufactured ignorance and confusion, the worship of division, the worship of bias and solipsism, elitism, baseless meritocracies, endless irrationality, self delusion, self-deceit!

Self-actualization is pruned and shaped. So much wasted potential. So many wastes lives. So much waste.

A trash planet. A plastic, superfluous life born from a baseless hope in an empty world. A waste of time.

Angry to be alive. Sure that I am damned. Regretful for whatever landed me in this awful version of what conscious life in this universe could have been.

Is this it?

Really? This shit? These creatures? Me?

A sick joke that never stops growing. An empty place. A demon's creation. 

A Hell with no endless fire; 
only more air than I could ever care to breathe, more moments than I could ever want. No demons; my tormentors are the masses happy enough to live on denial, ignorance, and bad faith.

Empty smiles that burn hotter than fire, slice harder than any sword. So many words with no meaning. So much done and said without meaning. Loneliness even among others.

Hell.

A spinning hell. Never stops spinning. The same pain and rage everyday.

"My hero is dead. I feel hella shitty, yet somewhat inspired to at least try and make my dream come true and to cast away the things that are causing me pain.","R.I.P. Mamba. Your passing gives me strength, I feel more compelled to fight for my own freedom and happiness. Your passing helps me remember that life is short and worthless, therefore allowing me to realize what is important to me in the grand scheme, and none of this stuff matters if it only causes me pain and suffering. They talk about school like it's the next big thing, the key to my future, academics and opportunities being stressed upon, but is it truly happiness if it takes away those things that feed my soul? If it eats at my soul and make a monster out of me? I'm done trying to chase the light and fake my way through. I will not hesitate to strike down anyone who threatens this dream of mine, whether it be a friend, my family, my own children, or even someone I consider to be a brother. I will give everything to fulfill my dream of running away, erasing my memory from everyone I ever knew, and starting a new life where I can support myself and do the things I love. A life where school, friends, family, don't have to irritate me. A life where I can make new friends and find people I truly consider my family. A life where I don't have to lose all the time. A life where I don't have to suffer anymore like that, a life where my suffering is of my own will and will reward me. A life where I have control over my own life."
"My birthday, i'm officially 17",so wtf i do with my life now
I'm so fucking lonely,"It's my 28th Birthday, and I've spent it alone. It's just another day but I can't stop fucking crying, I feel like I have no one in my life that I want and I've lost absolutely everything I held dear and close to me. I'm trying to get better but I am so lonely especially today it's crushing me."
How to find a will to live while working 9-5?,"I just feel hopeless. I hate doing it. I wake up at 7, get ready and get out of house by 8, am at work at 9, finish at 17 and am home by 18. Too exhausted to do anything, usually just crying because I know the next day will be the same.

I don't know what to do, it's a nightmare and I can't wake up"
"Life is mundane, boring and nothing excites me.","Just as the title says. I generally never get excited. I just live day to day emotionless. I don't care to meet people, old friends don't talk to me and I dont care to meet any new ones. I dont want to go out either. Lost all intrest in my hobbies, sometimes I'll do an activity out of habit but still feel empty. I just exist. My birthday is in a few weeks and I tell people to please just leave me alone, I don't want to have to fake being happy all day, its tiring. I dont want to kill my self but I want to know why I have to exist. I have a good job so I'll just focus on that for now."
Happiness is temporary and my depression will never go away,"Let's face the facts. No matter what I change or achieve in life... It might make me happier but only temporary. Then I will fall back into depression again, it was always like this. I am afraid that when I did and achieved everything in life I always wished, I might become content for a while but then become depressed again after a few days. Everything is just an illusion. When you are deep into depression and are suicidal, things like healthy food, vitamin d, sports, surgery, career, money, friends and adventure won't cure your depression. They might make it better than when you do the opposite of these things but they won't cure you. All you can do is learn to cope with it.

And I hate it when people that don't suffer from depression give me advice and say that it is bc I am not trying hard enough or I will be cured by doing these things."
Could i have saved her?,"""Aww, cya then..""

These are last words i heard from my friend SR, july 2, 2017, hours before she took her own life. Me and her have both been struggling with anorexia for years (i've been dealing with it since march 2010, she has since august 2012). I met her in mid 2013 along with 7 other anorexic at an ED gathering and the 9 of us have been eachother's outlets for self harm relief for all those years. I am the only one left standing of the group today. She was the last of the group to die.

On her day of death, she wanted to go out with me. We went out and had a blast, and she wanted me to stay over at her place for a little slumber party. Her house's pretty far from mine and i had an exam first thing in the morning so i refused.

""Aww, cya then.."" as i left.

Later that evening she rolled the dice and landed on the wrong side. Her dying wish was that everyone left alive from the group would celebrate her life instead of mourning her death.

Could i have saved her? Could i have stayed over and kept her going? Would it have kept her going for much longer? Is it my fault? She was my only reason to live. So why am i alive? Why, out of 9, do i have to tell the story? Why did i click that goddamn proana link back in 2010 that shot me into the worst fight of my life at age 7? I turned 15 years old 16 days after her death. Why did i keep rolling the dice, attempt after attempt, only to be the only one left standing today? 

I miss you. How's heaven? Hope they got a lot of horses there. I know you want me to keep fighting, but i just want to be with the 8 of you again. Why was i the one to recover? 

I could have saved her. I could have. But i didnt

I only exist to help out the people that need me"
God how do you guys relax,I just got an internship I've been working so hard to get for the last two years. Its only my first day but I've managed to upset my boss. I just need reassurance that I won't get fired or I honestly think I'm going to commit suicide.  I might be overthinking it but I'm so genuinely scared that I'm about to fuck up so hard.
Haha so many posts about coronavirus on anxiety sub but not depression sub,"I have depression and what is considered severe anxiety. But my depression wins here. I feel so bad for the people dying. It’d be a horrible way to go, but I still wish I could go in someone’s place. 

I used to be so afraid of things that would kill me, and the depression took that all away. Funny. Now I just fear everything about living."
I've brushed my hair for the first time in a few weeks,"I'm honestly so happy. First off my two ""friends"" cut me off and it destroyed me for while but I realized It was good for me. I got up today and ate a lot. I was listening to some Fall Out Boy songs and they really just made me rethink how i was viewing this lose of friends. I then got up out of my bed and made coffee and brushed me hair. This is the first time in a while i'm crying because i'm happy. I'm not cleaning my room because there is food everywhere but i'm so happy. Brushing my hair is a milestone that really made me feel better about myself. I had washed it a few weeks ago and but it into a bun and just kinda left it for a while. My parents think it's stupid that i'm so excited but i don't care. I'm proud of myself and that's all that matters."
happiness is a joke that fools us all,today i woke up the happiest i’ve been in months and i was hoping this happiness will last and continue all day and in a snap of finger it was gone. you can never just have a good day.
Why i can't end it all,I want to end it all but i'm such a pussy i can't do it. I have no motivation to live i'm worthless and i need to die
"I'm alive, but I don't feel like I'm living.","I'm a very passive person, or maybe it would be more correct to say that I'm a pushover. I don't know what I want and I'm not doing much to get it. I'm tired. Wasn't life supposed to be active? Weren't we supposed to scratch and claw for the things we want? Instead, we're sitting in the shadows of better men and women, waiting for our collective shit to choke the planet to death.

Dont let depression make you hate yourself,"I'm 25, 5""11, 168 pounds, in shape and decent looking. No social problems. I'm okay with talking to new people and I'm relatively funny. 

Today I woke up, cried for an hour, watched some funny videos to pick my spirits up. Force fed myself some eggs, got sick from eating without an appetite, got sick some more from anxiety. Force fed myself some chicken in the afternoon and again in the evening just to keep my body running. Spent the whole day in bed, sent my ex a pathetic video, cried for an hour, apologized for the video and cried some more. This is my regular routine. (First time sending a video)

You dont have to be ugly, fat, socially awkward or humourless to be depressed. People from all shapes, sizes and backgrounds go through this. If you're suffering from depression and wishing you were better looking or taller or thinner, stop. It doesn't make it easier. It's mental, in your brain and that makes you hate yourself and wish you were different. No matter what I do for myself or how many girls are interested, i still feel disgusting and unwanted. I hate my depression, I refuse to hate myself because of it."
Today was triggering...,"So this news about Kobe Bryant and her daughter was really rough to hear. It was especially triggering, though, because let’s just say it is very very similiar to a major trauma i experienced in the past. 

I’m not gonna sit here and pretend like i was some huge Kobe stan, but this sh*t really got me worse than i thought it would.. At first i was taking the news normally and couple hours later i was suddenly sobbing in my car?? I had to go home from work early and everything!

I’m mostly just mad/confused at how a random news headline could bring up such intense feelings from my past. Haven’t really been triggered like that in a long time. Was curious to know if anyone else here was feeling the same way today"
There's something shitty about Sundays,"I think Sunday signifies the end of the week for me, so I look back on the previous 6 days, realize I haven't gotten anywhere, then look ahead and realize I have no plans or goals for the week ahead, either. So, Sunday always reminds me that I am very stuck, and I'm not making any progress :/

I'm doing okay, though, not in crisis mode or anything. I hope the same is true for you."
URGENT HELP,I have a friend who was contacted by a LONG DISTANCE friend who called to say goodbye and said he is commiting suicide tomorrow. He lives in the UK and we do not know exactly where he lives so we do not know who to contact if even there is someone we could contact.  If anyone has any tips or something anything is appreciated.
"Lonely, wanna talk?","So lately I’ve been finding myself spiraling more and more into darker and darker depressive states and that coupled with the fact that desperately lonely working at a job where everyone’s an obnoxious asshole just waiting to throw each other under the bus isn’t helping. I just need someone to talk to literally anyone. I’m into motorcycles (just bought a 2013 Yamaha Stryker and super stoked about that), I love coffee, and books ranging anywhere from high fantasy to science fiction to lesbian romances, oh and videos games ocarina of time is my favorite. Is this weird? I’m just looking for another soul to talk to I’m desperate at this point."
crying into my nachos,"i made this big thing of nachos. went all out. 

and i was eating it alone in my bedroom in front of netflix. i get to a really dramatic scene in the show. intensely emotional. i'm watching scenes of people living their lives to the fullest. experiencing life and really living. and i know it's a fictional show, it's all make believe. but thinking about all of the life i'm not living and i'm watching the show while i'm shoveling nachos into my fat pathetic face. 

the whole situation must've looked so goddamn sad.

the nachos were fucking delicious though. so no regrets."
It seems like there's two ways to make yourself go insane.,"1. Be left alone with your thoughts.
2. Distract yourself from your thoughts.

Don't give up,"Greet the darkness, it is a test of your courage."
I want to stop having to try,"I just want to die, for real, i don't want to keep trying to do this anymore, why the fuck was i born, i hate living so much."
37yrs old and I’ve lost my way.,"I’m a schizophrenic guy who lives with his parents at 37 and still get treated like a child. I get emotionally and verbally abused by my father daily and on top of that I have paranoid delusions that my neighbors can hear my thoughts. This leads to a ton of stress and anxiety and I don’t know how to handle it, I’m never good enough for my dad. I think about ending my life everyday but I’m too much of a coward to do it so I just have to take his shit until he dies."
I’m too tired to do shit.,"I’m probably going to fail all my fucking classes, since I almost never have the energy to do shit. My life is fucked up."
This is solitude and loneliness,"I haven't wanted to talk to anyone because I feel like no one can listen to me the way I need to feel heard. Why waste my time or my voice? Why inconvenience people when I'm supposed to be the strong one? I'm already tired. 

I have been mostly in solitude lately. I talk to myself more than I talk to other humans. I live alone, in a state far away from friends and family. The friendships I've developed here seem trivial compared to the ones I have back home. It was fine for a while but it's not working anymore. I feel like I am on other people's schedule and not my own; like I am at their beck and call for company when they need it. But I could have used company today and mindless conversation. I paced my apartment doing random chores and putting off important things I needed to do. What I needed to do would have taken too much mental stamina that I knew I didn't have.

So what's a girl to do? Spend her entire 30s feeling this way? My friends in their 30s always tell me that these are the best years for them so far but these past few months have been some of my worst. I have gone through much of my life being alone but never feeling very lonely. I feel lonely lately and I hate that. I haven't experienced physical touch in a long time; not even a good hug. I want to feel connected to someone more than ever and it's not happening.

Thank you for listening, internet."
I'll probably never date again.,"It has been years since I've been on a date, about a decade since I had a relationship. It doesn't usually bother me, it is so low on my list of issues that it doesn't even occur to me. I'm used to being alone at this point, I don't expect people to want me, I wouldn't want me.

That being said, I went through my old messages today and found out it has been half a year since I even got a reply on a dating website. Not from lack of trying, messaging the new faces on the varied dating websites is part of my daily routine. I've sent out thousands of messages, and not generic ""hellos"" ""hru"", I message them about something that piqued my interest on their profile. Or if nothing piqued my interest I at least try to open with a question about their life instead of a generic ""Hi"". I'm not just on one website either so it isn't like I was shadowbanned unless they collectively decided to ban me.

But no responses, at all. Not even a ""not interested"". Like, holy shit, talk to me before you reject me. You don't even know that I'm a broke loser with no car, no ambition, severe depressive issues and suicidal ideation, I'm not opening with that or putting that on my profile. I'm not the best looking guy, but I'm not hideously deformed either, while I'm sure my looks run off a decent amount of people they shouldn't run off everyone. I even make sure to put a picture or two of myself in my military uniform, I should at least get the ""support the troops"" reply here and there, right?

Probably for the best, I can't afford to date anyways, but fuck, a conversation here and there would be nice."
How do you lie about your interests and not get caught?,I hate when I tell people about myself and they remember what I said and bring it up later. I can't admit that I made it all up and that my only hobby is sleeping. It's hard to come up with something niche enough that you're unlikely to meet someone with that same interest and broad enough that your shallow knowledge of the subject won't be questioned.
The world is too dark a place,"Things have just gotten really shitty this year and they just dont seem to be getting better. When I think they do, something else happens. I know you should be happy in your life but I just cant feel happy lately, knowing all the messed up crap going on in the world. I just want everything to stop. It just feels like I am being swallowed up by darkness. Lately pain has meant nothing to me
 I would kill myself it I wasnt scared of death itself. But it cant be worse than life right now. It just feels like everyone I know is slowly dying along with the things that I like being ruined by narcissists. I want to help people but there is freaking nothing I can do. All I can do is get closer to my eventual death and surpass others who have died before me."
I'm tired of people being sorry,"Is anyone tired of people saying they are sorry like I'm sorry you have to go through this, I'm sorry they died, I'm sorry you feel like this, I'm sorry you had a bad day, I'm sorry I didn't mean to say that (for something that might seem insensitive). Just to clarify I don't mean anything bad these people are lovely and I care about them lots but I feel like they go round on tip toes or say sorry because they don't know what to say like it's not there fault can they please stop saying that, I've repeatedly told them not to as it isn't there fault I'm like this. Depression sucks but I don't wanna be treated differently. Is it wrong for me to want them to say that I don't want them to be sorry about how I feel and how I don't deserve it, I just wanna be left in peace and to not have to deal with all of this smothering, I get it's because they care but it's too much."
Why did I have to be born?,"Is the only thing I can ask myself for the last couple days. I truly think it was a mistake and I am not supposed to be here, alive. I keep recalling how much abuse my parents put me trough for 25 years and I don't think it was fair. My earliest memories are mom screaming, screaming, always screaming. At everything at everyone at me. Me sitting on the chair by the corner, getting ready to go to school, needing help with my socks, - ""they don't feel right"" -, I would say, she would scream saying I don't get it, they are ok. Mom and dad leaving me behind because I didn't put on my shoes. Ridiculing me as a childn at parties or events centered around me because I would get overwhelmed and didn't want to take part in. Mom dragging me by the hair through the house like a doll, beating me with a belt till my legs bled. Friends, sports?, no, those required involment, here's the TV, figure it out. We move cities, teenage years, the beatings just get worse, I am bigger, I can handle harder, dad can punch me now, in the back, that pain I get when my back is strained from work, thank you dad for reminding me of you. Slaps, screaming, more hair pulling, name calling. - ""if I knew the kind of bitch you would've end up being I would've never dated you father"" -. Thank you mom I was only 12 but I will always remember this. Can't do math, my brain doesn't get it, I struggle, school is hard, I get my report cards threw at my face while hearing how much of an idiot I am, a disappointment, stupid. You were unfair and I wanted to get away, I locked myself in my room, no, you can't, dad punched a whole in the wall and opens it, he beats you up, I am 16, I still have the pictures of my beated up body in my computer, because I thought i could do something and I couldn't. Med school, you guys are proud of me now right?, less beatings, you talk good about me, I feel important, I made it, I have a job, you don't. Mom never worked, she was busy raising me and my sister, dad could never keep one for longer than a year. You need money for your rent?, but i live in a different city, sure, thays what good daughters do right?. You need more money? Yeah no problem, I will just eat ramen and boiled eggs this month. That's what a good daughter does right?. Making me prostitute myself online when I was 21 so you guys could take the money I made doing so is what good daughters do right?. Eating my feelings because the only way you show me love is trough food and getting an eating disorder is what good daughters do right?. Leaving teraphy after my first suicide attempt because you asked me to is what good daughter do right?. Am I right?."
IAmA 20 year old male who can't decide if he should kill himself," I really doubt I'll reach the age of 25 and definitely plan to end it by then, but at this point I don't know what to do. I feel like life is pointless, When I talk to people I just get worried about what they will do, I have constant paranoia, I constantly worry about things like breathing properly, walking properly, blinking properly and it's to the point I can't do these things without putting all my attention into them. I don't care if people will be saddened by my death, but there are some things I'm looking forward to in the future. The problem is I know that there will always be things I look forward to and I feel like they'll just drive me to keep going on with something I don't enjoy the majority of the time. That of course being life. I'm not even sure why I posted this."
"Suicide, oh you toxic bitch","Lately I’ve been so suicidal, mad at the world, mad at myself and mad at the people who have treated me so badly and never once genuinely apologize. I’m bitter. I’m in therapy yes, but it’s only made me overthink more. I think often of the suixide notes I’d leave my family and boyfriend, how much I love them but I couldn’t tell them that their actions that affected me are the reason that brought me here (excluding my bf). They aren’t all to blame though. I’m mad at myself for being this weak and this low. It sucks. This depression is strong but I need to keep fighting, even if I don’t want to. I’m truly so sad and hurt. I want this to go away so bad. I pray everyday for it to go away. It just randomly gets to me, for no real reason. Some day’s I just wake up mad and I want to cry bc I wish I didn’t."
im talking to myself,"im so lonely, i'm having a conversation by myself. im losing my fucking mind"
you ever feel like an afterthought ?,"it’s hard to explain but, i know i have friends that i think care about me , but my mind is always telling me that nobody cares about my existence and wouldn’t make a difference if i wasn’t around"
I should stop expressing myself. It just makes everyone sad.,"I sometimes try to open up a little. I told my friends I was having random crying sessions and I wasn’t sure why. They were kind of supportive for a while. 

I got a message from one of them just now. She just read the chat and told me I shouldn’t be sad. She meant it in a nice way, but the way she worded it just felt wrong. She told me it made her sad. I told her she shouldn’t be sad, and she responded, in a joking way, with; “then don’t make me sad, hmph”

It was probably not meant in a mean way. But I don’t want to make my friends sad. So I think it’s better not to talk about my feelings. I don’t want anyone to be affected negatively by my feelings."
My misery stems from being ugly/unattractive : BDD,"I am miserable and depressed because I am ugly. It is simple as that. When I say ugly, I don't mean it in terms of mere ugly to beautiful spectrum. I am unattractive because I am strange looking. I'm abnormally assymetrical, my skin is saggy, I have a boulder face, the list goes on and on. I am so frustrated because I am aware that appearance is not everything and that I'm wasting so much time, so much of this existence obsessing over something so superficial. Our current society makes us believe that appearance play a big part in determining self-worth and value, but I acknowledge that this is due to toxic lookism and that there are far more important aspects of life that I need to prioritize over. Even so, I can't even live by my words or beliefs, because I'm already taken over by my bdd. Prior to doing anything to advance in life, I feel like I need to change the way I look so that I can look like an average, ordinary person. The way I can describe this feeling is like having to constantly try and fulfill the prerequisites that others already have in life, so Its just like an endless cycle of self-hate and hopelessness. Every footstep is so delayed, I never move on forward. I'm always battling with myself on the inside, and I have no energy or will to face real life. Everything just seems so meaningless. It's become a daily routine to ask myself whether or not I should die today. I will never be able to live an average life. I will never have a stable mind or body. I will always look like me, and that alone makes a good enough reason for me to put an end to everything."
"Dont click, not worth your time","I mean, if I just disappeared one day, would anyone miss me? My mom doesn't really love me, i don't have a girlfriend, and my siblings pretend i don't exist anyway. I dunno if my life has any real meaning anymore."
It *doesn't* get better.,"I fixed the sentence for anyone who claims that ""it gets better"". No, it fucking doesn't. Things only get worse and we suffer more until we eventually die."
What are the top two things you hate about depression?,"Mine are:

1. Lack of motivation resulting in procrastination, resulting in not getting anything done.
2. Having nothing to say, like my mind just goes blank when someone asks me a question. Hell even when I ask myself a question my mind goes blank."
i just canceled my cell phone service,"nobody ever calls me and i need to save some money. i have no friends, i don't ever use my phone anyway. im gonna die and nobody will ever miss me, care or even notice. fuck all of u"
"Unpopular opinion: 14 y.o. girls that say they are depressed, aren't just being dramatic",My best friend killed herself today
I feel like I am not meant to exist in this universe.,"For as long as I can remember, I've felt fundamentally different than other people (in a bad way). It's not just that I feel different, it's that I feel like there is something seriously wrong with me that prevents me from ever having any real connection to anyone. I had friends in school, but I've slowly lost them over the years. Most of the time it has been my fault for being overly sensitive and needy, and being hypervigilant to whether or not they like me or if they're ignoring me. I've ghosted people purely on the suspicion that they are ignoring me or that they secretly think I'm a disgusting little bug that deserves to be crushed under a shoe. I've done and said genuinely stupid and hurtful shit that has further cemented in my mind that I am a piece of garbage that should be incinerated. Just looking through my youtube comments from 4 years ago make me cringe. I was an asshole and I still can be from time to time. I also feel parasitic because I barely work, and I spend most of my time jerking off to weird shit that isn't even real (furries) and playing videogames that I don't even like half the time. I still live with my parents, and they both work their asses off. It makes me feel guilty that I am indirectly making them suffer because of my own failures as a human being.
I hate my job and the people I work with, but I have absolutely no hope that I can achieve success in any sort of career or endeavor that I'm actually interested in. So I feel like I'm stuck not making enough money to support myself and doing menial bullshit until I die. It feels like I've passed the point of no return, and I am going to be stuck all by myself in hell forever. I kind of realize that this is really dramatic and grandiose language but that's just how it feels to me. I'm in therapy, and it's helping a little, but my therapist seems like she has a few more screws loose than me based on things she has said. She's very superstitious and seems to think she has special powers. She also NEVER admits when she is wrong. I have tried psych meds in the past (prozac, wellbutrin, abilify) but they never seemed to do much of anything besides give me annoying side effects. I'm thinking of trying anti-depressants again even though I don't have much faith in them. I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't give any good reasons for why I am still alive. I'm mentally stuck in the past and I have no hope for the future. The End."
black hole,"Does anyone else constantly have this deep, dark, black hole/pit feeling inside of them. It’s kind of felt in my chest and stomach. It’s a deep sinking feeling, like there’s a weight constantly pulling me to the floor. 
I want to cry but I can’t, and I feel perfectly fine but at the same time incredibly depressed.

It’s consuming me and I hate it and I want it to leave."
A year ago today I attempted suicide,it’s like theres both this shame/regret for having ever tried it in the first place and for having tried it and failing. its just a really weird feeling to recall something as serious and intense as trying to kill yourself...
Nobody hates me as much as I hate myself,"Self-deprecation has become so natural for me that I can't even imagine myself existing without it. Whenever I feel a little bit better about myself, I feel sick and then I'm back to being my self-hating-self again. I get mad at people who say nice things to me because i know theyre lying."
An ode to all the things I wish the suicide hotline person had done and said,"I lurk most of the time, and sometimes when I am utterly at a loss for how to get myself through my lowest moments, I just look up random shit on the internet related to what I am dealing with. Which often leads me to reddit. So here I am not lurking.

I've tried a variety of suicide and crisis lines when I had no one else to talk to, and the overwhelming majority have been stuffed with either well meaning but naive people who don't know what to say, people tongue tied by liability scripts, and the occasional authentic person who actually cares and makes you feel better. 

Here's some of the things I think of after I hang up with them or leave the conversation which I wish they would have done or said, usually while I am still feeling horrifically lonely and overwhelmed and wishing I could die, but fantasizing about how I would help people if I could:



1) sound like a real actual person. Not a robot, not a script, not a person who is afraid of or uncomfortable with sadness. Someone who says ""hey, I'm sorry things are so shitty right now but wanna talk to me? Lord knows I get how shitty shit can get. At least you won't be alone for a few minutes in the shitty shit.""



2) ask them, without encouraging rumination on details, what is the emotion you are feeling right this second, right now, here, on this phone call. Give it a name. And once it has a name, where does it live in your body? What does it feel like? What is it, and what is your body, what is your heart, what is your soul, asking for from you right now? What does it need? And not what the shitty voices inside you want you to say, what is it your emotion is truly telling you that you need. And is there a way you can get that or give that to it? In a healthy, positive way of course. Is there even one thing you can do right now to help give your heart what it is truly craving. A hug, someone to listen to what you need to say, some healthy food, sleep, compassion, a nice refreshing glass of water...something. And really sell the point on just how fucking refreshing that glass of water can be right now.



3) if you know where this despair, loneliness, and pain live in your body, is there any way you can move that part of the body? Shake it up, with me, on the phone right now. I shit you not I once had a therapist who I called in crisis and he made me get out of my car in a crowded parking lot while I was on the phone with him and do 30 seconds of jumping jacks. And you know what, it fucking worked.



4) mindfulness over the phone actually does work, as per my last bullet point. Doing a breathing exercises together, going on a little scavenger hunt, talking someone through doing something to cope. Stupid or serious, doing something together and laughing about it even with a complete stranger is an oddly beautiful experience.



5) admitting to the person who called the hotline that you do not have all the answers, and sometimes you are at a loss for what to say, but that you are here, even to listen, to distract, to breathe in the same space. Some tragedy has no accurate or perfect response, but acceptance, and compassion, those are always the right answer.


6) asking them about something that gives them motivation and makes them truly happy. Then googling that thing while on the hotline call and giving them fun facts about it to remind them of something they love in the world. Getting them to remember and maybe even talk about something that gives them a sense of passion and purpose. Reminding them why they might like to keep being alive.



7) singing. Just. Anything involving singing. Together or otherwise. Sing the national anthem together. Sing them an Elvis Costello song. Have them sing you their favorite song. It's worth a shot. Why the fuck not. If it's the last thing they ever talk about with someone, at least it was musical. Bonus if you can somehow incorporate a musical instrument.



8) tell me more ideas in the comments. 



Because how cool would a community sourced crisis line be, am I right? Here's to wishing for better, brighter, more clever, more humane, crisis salvation. We're all alone, and in it together anyway. Might as well try something."
Not even the will to change,Has anyone been so depressed and discouraged that you  didn’t even have the will  or energy to change ? And if you’ve gotten through this how did you do it?
My Husband doesn't want me anymore,"I have been depressed my whole life. It has ups and downs. I had a baby 6 months ago and I'm not sure I was meant to be a mother. I had terrible complications and spent 4 weeks in the hospital and he came 10 weeks early and spent 7 weeks in the NICU. I had a lot of support when I was sick, but when you have a sick baby, all your friends leave. I barely had any to begin with, but now I really don't have any. I have one friend who lives in another state and that's it. I wasn't attractive before I got pregnant, but I look even worse now. I'm trying to lose weight, but being constantly hungry is depressing me even more. My husband doesn't want to have sex with me anymore. He says it isn't my fault, but he never had any problems getting it up before I had the baby. He used to want to have sex all the time. I used to be young and cute and I feel like I wasted it all. I grew up in a religious household and I didn't have sex until I started dating my husband. I should have been out sleeping around. Now I am a hideous, sexually frustrated 31 year old with a baby that I can't handle. And I love my husband, even if someone was interested in sleeping with me, how could I hurt him like that? On top of everything, I have a coworker that I am friends with who I am very attracted to. We are getting to be good friends and are even a little flirty sometimes. The good thing is, he is a good bit younger than me so I doubt he is attracted to me. I think he just sees me as an older friend. I want to think that I wouldn't sleep with him if he made a move, but I am so broken and frustrated, I just might. I am just grateful that I don't think he is thinking the same way about me."
I wish I could cry,"I wish I could cry right now but the tears just won’t come. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I have absolutely no reason to feel this way, so many people have it so much worse than me, yet I feel like this anyway. It’s never going away.

A part of me want to reach out and get professional help and then the other part of me believes it won’t work anyway and I deserve to feel terrible because I’m a shit person who is just a nuisance and a burden for everyone."
I turned 18 today,I honestly didn’t think I’d get here. Everyday I’ve thought about dying.
Here goes...,"Never thought I'd be posting this but here goes. I'm a 23 year old male.

My life has never gone very well. As a child I was always very shy and a bit socially unaware. Never had many friends in school and was alone most of the time. My grades in elementary school were good but then came middle school and high school.

I think my depression started in middle school. I always felt very different from all the other kids. I was not good at sports or really anything for that matter. I started putting on weight and am not very attractive to begin with. Always alone usually. I was bullied alot as well.

It got so bad that by junior year in high school id play sick and just refuse to go to school. I couldnt take it anymore. Eventually just full on dropped out of high school.

Fast foward. Here I am at age 23 almost 24. Still living at home, have a shit job, and zero friends still.

I lost 2 people to suicide last year. One was a childhood friend the other an online friend. Both shot themselves. It messed me up pretty good.

Being alone for all these years is just to hard. I don't think I can take it anymore. Every year gets worse and worse and everyday i just get even more fucked up. I'm zapped of all emotions to the point i can't even cry anymore. I drink heavily every night and smoke a ton of weed to try to escape my sad existence.

Thank you for listening to me rant reddit."
Where did all of my copes go?,The title basically sums it up. The music I usually listen to doesn't work anymore and almost nothing makes me happy anymore. I feel so numb and empty inside.
Suicidal thoughts from 8 years old,"I have had the desire for my life to end since I was 8 years old. A second grade writing assignment for an ""I wish"" poem had me wracking my brain for anything that I wanted, and my autistic ass couldn't come up with anything. The one honest idea that I kept coming to was that I wanted to be dead. The feeling of nothingness felt soothing to me. So I wrote I wished I was dead and  a few lines elaborating and turned it in.

I remember seeing a psychiatrist sometime after as a result. I felt very uncomfortable and asked my mother to not go back and I never did. 

I am now 26  and suicidal thoughts and undiagnosed depression and anxiety has plagued my life with few respites during my life. I feel like sisyphus pushing the boulder up the hill each day for eternity. I've kept living out of sheer will and I'm waiting for the day it gets easier."
"Once a week, just include me once a week it's all I want.","Just once a week it's all I ask, once a week make me feel like someone cares. All I want is to feel like I am someone's friend, and that someone wants my company. My friends can meet someone once and be best friends forever, and invite them everywhere well why not me? Am I disgusting? Am I come? Please I am begging just include me.

I can sit in my dorm and no one ever knocks, no one ever calls. I just want someone to show up and say, ""please come to supper with us,"" or ""We are going out for the night want to come?"" Is it so hard? IF I AM YOUR FRIEND WHY AM I ALWAYS DOING ALL THE WORK? YOU DON'T MAKE OTHER FRIENDS DO THIS!

I am not a bad person am I? I don't think I am but I don't know anymore. I help people with school work, I share my food, I give rides, I give compliment, I try to make people laugh, I donate blood. Why is the guy who teases and calls people ugly given preferential treatment? WHY AM I ALWAYS AT THE BOTTOM OF TOTEM POLE? 

I am sorry I needed that out."
:),"Hey, is there a pause button on life?"
"For me, happiness is merely a word now, rather than an emotion that is felt","Achieving it seems impossible. I am not living for myself anymore, but rather those around me.

Ive tried everything I can. Nothing works. Nothing ever works. I end up trying and as a result I just become more tired than I was before I started.

Im afraid that if I let my depression continue to run amok, I’m going to lose interest in talking to people altogether. Its already started to show. All these empty relationships I have with people, nobody who genuinely cares. My socialization skills have gotten worse because of a lack of meaningful relationships with people.

I’m becoming more silent, both online and real life. Im becoming a ghost. People not talking to me in person as much anymore, slowly disappearing off of peoples friends lists online. Slowly forgotten by society, left on the sidelines.

I dont feel like im friends with my friends. I feel like I only keep them in my life so I don’t end up totally alone.

Nobody cares about what I’m feeling. People only pretend to care, I can see right through them. I feel theres no point in sharing any emotions, problems, or experiences with friends or acquaintances, because theres no real reason to. Theres no point in talking to a wall who pretends to care about what you’re feeling. This is why therapy was such a failure for me.

Most people just want you to stop talking so they can begin. Others only listen for the sake of listening, never “connecting” with anything I say. 

Im losing control of my life. In the back of my head, there contains many wonders if I’ll die alone or get anything I want in my life. Part of me doesnt want to believe it, but another part of me knows it to be true. I’m going to die alone on a rainy September afternoon. 

I’m really scared. This emptiness is so addictive. Its all I’ve felt my entire life. Its the kind of emptiness that calls you back home to wallow in self pity whenever you’re outside.

If I dont do anything soon, something bad is going to happen. I know it. I’m alone whilst surrounded by people, in a world full of people.

Time can’t heal this. Ive waited too long. I dont know what to do. Im about ready to give up. I really cant do this anymore. Help isnt coming, nothing makes me feel better in the slightest. 

Please help me. Please. Im begging anyone here. Please. I dont want to be here anymore. Please take me away from here."
I don’t want to be here anymore,"I don’t want to be who I am anymore. I hate myself I hate my past I hate my future and I don’t want to keep living, I don’t want to keep crying, I just want to fall asleep and never wake up. I just want this dream to end. I just want this to all be over"
"I want to kill myself, finally","Today is a special day, after a major family drama, that brought to light that they never cared for me in any way and my endless cycles of failures, i decided at a core level to kill myself. I'm an illustrator trying to make a living, failed time and time again in these endeavors and also failed trying to balance dayjobs and art-work. I'm also from a poor family in a 3rd world piece of shit country (currently under a revolution) that has mental health as a millenial myth, the neverending stress and failure, the eternal ""I'll make it this time"" only to fail again has me... Totally defeated. I also have a very good hearing, a bloody curse that hasn't allowed me to sleep, victim to noisy neighboors for at least 14 years now, and counting. I have friends that care for me but... They don't get it, they have love in their lives from family or couples, they prefer to see me alive and suffering rather than dead and happy..And today, I finally left any fear of knives on my arms, one I had for years after seeing my dad with scars due to his suicide attempts... My ex and former close friends taught me that mentally ill people don't deserve happiness, I would get some if they were wrong.  


But the point remains, I haven't done it yet even tho I totally want to, I cannot stand the suffering anymore, the failures, loneliness, poverty. I its place I came to a corner of the internet to be ignored and/or insulted as I have already been on other posts. But who cares anyway?"
Kobe Squeezed Every Drop From his life,What the heck am I doing rotting away in depression?
My pops passed on Christmas,"And I had to move back home from Texas.. and it’s killing me more and more everyday that I’m back home. Monotonous people,places & things.. 

Here to take care of my mom.. but it’s killing me silently."
It’s so miserable knowing how much you’ve disappointed everyone.,"I’ve been reading text messages from just after high school where everyone is telling me how proud they are of me and how they can’t wait to see what my future will be like...

Four years later, all of them either hate me or have forgotten about me. The only people that still like me are my parents. I have next to no future prospects other than suicide or loneliness and mediocrity.

I just wish it didn’t have to be like this. Maybe it didn’t and I just fucked it up somehow. I just wish I could feel happy again like I did back then."

Successfully revealing your depression?,"Just wondering has anybody ever revealed their depression to someone close, who they initially thought would react horribly and cause a lot of trouble, only to have everything turn out fine or even great in the end? If so, what was the experience like? And were there things that u missed before that could have allowed you to change your initial opinion and predict what actually happened?"
High-functioning,"i think my life stopped in late 2015. it was the time i had my full-blown symptoms show up as well as when i got diagnosed. i had dreams i wanted to achieve before then. i think i still have dreams, but i keep asking myself what’s even the point. i don’t even want to be alive anymore. i’ve already set some sort of date when i feel like it’s okay for me to go


tbh, i feel so tired. i keep buying and wanting things hoping they would fill the void. and they do for about a few minutes then it’s back to the same boring life


i can work although it’s from home since i can’t really hold a “full-time” job. my current job is actually the longest job i’ve ever had. i force myself to work because it’s a good distraction. also because i got bills to pay from buying stuff. i can’t pass them to my family as i’m already a burden enough as it is


i feel like life just isn’t for me. i feel suicidal, but i can’t even harm myself because i’ve built up some sort of self-control which is good, medically speaking, i guess


i want to cry, but i can’t. i feel numb. i’m in pain both physically and emotionally


what is this hell? like what the actually fuck?!"
I’m celebrating 420 karma,The only thing good going in my life right now.
I’m alive and I’m grateful (for once),"Today has been hard. I don’t know why, but the death of Kobe Bryant, his daughter, and everyone else on that plane really hit me hard. Really really hard. I’m not a basketball fan at all. It’s just a terrible thing. It’s truly awful. But it made me realize that I am lucky to be here. Gigi was 13 and she had dreams. She wanted things in life and she was happy. She had so much to do but now she can never do it. She’s gone, along with her dad, who made such a big impact on the world. They’re both gone. But I am still here, and I want to squeeze every second of happiness that I can out of the time I have left. Life is so fragile and I’ve spent too much of it feeling helpless and sorry for myself, when it could be gone in an instant. So fuck this unfair world. Fuck this depression. Fuck the little voice in my head that tells me I will never achieve anything in life. I may not get everything that I want, but I can at least try. I promise to start really living, to start enjoying life more. Because I am alive. And I’m grateful for that."
... a poem (trigger warning),"I express my stress hopefully it doesnt come off as a whine, everything is good, yes everything is fine.

They call me lazy, so maybe that's my crime, I feel so mixed up inside so call me Frankenstein.

Hold my hand, please.  And please don't fall away, I know that we can make it, even when the sky is gray.

I never cared what they thought about you, I never paid them any mind, they say  you are worthless but I know  you're one of a kind.

Please stay with me forever, you're not dumb you're clever. We never minded the rain we enjoy all the weather.  They dont see our value but that's because they don't know how to measure, you're my treasure and a pleasure to know.

I'll end my poem for now, but I wish you'd stay and not go.

The amount of hate I have for myself is intolerable,"18F

It’s not even me being insecure at this point - it’s just the truth. No one will ever love me. No one wants someone like me. I have so much love to give to people - I care a lot. But I’m giving up on ever finding true friends or true love at this point. I don’t deserve it.

I hate the way I look, the way I act (mildly autistic). It honestly hurts so much knowing that I’m going to be alone forever. I hate my mental health (depression, anxiety) I hate that I’m overbearing when I’m just trying to be nice.

I hate myself so much. I have no purpose and nothing to live for"
I just want the pain to stop.,"I was driving on an empty highway when I closed my eyes and let go of my steering wheel. I made sure I was going 80mph before I shut them, so that if I were to crash into a tree, it would most likely be fatal. I unclicked my seatbelt and listened closely to the sound of the revving engine as I pressed the accelerator to the floor. 90mph. 100mph. 110mph. I inhaled deeply took what I thought would be my last breath. Finally, the pain would stop. In that moment, I felt clarity.

I opened my eyes when I felt my car violently shake from speeding over shoulder bumps. Fear overcame me, so I regulated my speed and found my way back into the center lane. Once again I failed, like the coward I am."
How to live with this type of emotional pain?,My life is just pain. Emotional and physical pain. Trauma that I went through a long time ago and in recent years ruins my mental state all the time. I am constantly angry and depressed. I cannot function. Therapy and meds I have already done to no avail (those are not options at the moment). Does anyone know how to live with this pain?
A terribly long rant. I'm sorry if you read this. I just don't have anyone to really rant to.,"I wish I had a friend that I could talk to with no worries. Someone to share my thoughts comfortably. I have 3 friends that I still speak with occasionally, but it's not the same. 2 moved to outer state colleges and the other is always busy with their life, school and work,etc.  It's just how life is, how eventually everyone you met in high school go their separate ways and find their own new friends and such. And I feel as if I am stuck and not moving forward. I feel as if I am left behind as I watch others move on. I miss having someone to talk to whenever. But I worry that I burden them or annoy them and it sucks. 

I struggle socially, but I try to make an effort to make ""friends"" in college. And when I do manage to make a few friends, they don't seem interested in actually being anything more than a peer to get hw answers from. I sometimes hated myself for being an asian because I feel like people only get close to me just to benefit. Last semester was awfully terrible for me, mentally. I was nervous about being able to make friends and I had transferred from Uni to a community college for financial reasons. I was super happy that I managed to get to know my peers in 2 of my classes. Everything was going well and I was actually looking forward to this entire semester, but I began to notice something off. In one class, one would text me for hw answers and I was totally fine with giving, and eventually they'd miss a day or two from class and ask for updates. I thought i was overthinking things and ignored them, but then I'd notice how almost everytime they'd ask for hw answers but never return the favor. Another would deliberately try to make me look dumb in front of the prof. They'd ask me a question about the assignment and I would reply honestly that I didnt know the answer to and that they should ask the professor for clarification. And when they do, they'd turn to me and exclaim, ""SEE I TOLD YOU SO!"". The first time they did that I was so confused as to what they ""told me"". Then I'd notice how almost every class period we had, they'd do the same thing over again. I hated it. I'm a nice person and I'm not the kind to talk back, so I'd just sit there...and take it, I guess. It was mentally draining and i hated going to the class. Whenever they do it, i felt everyone's eyes stare through me and i felt so uncomfortable. The third person on my table mostly kept to themselves and would occasionally ask for help,but they too would have a remark or two about how ""smart"" I was and that I got everything handled. She made it seemed as if I was such a genius that everything came easy and she'd laugh it off as a joke. It was suffocating. I shifted my focus on my schoolwork and made perfect marks on my exams and whenever the prof handed the test papers for us to see, I could tell they were jealous and it seeped off them. I could feel it. We'd all compare our exams and they'd be annoyed that they couldn't get an A even though they studied a lot. And I was shocked I even made perfect marks on the exam because I've never done that my entire life. I truly felt the exam was difficult and it was exhausting spending hours and hours studying and I would tell them all of that. And they'd reply with a sarcastic remark. Eventually I'd stop giving out my opinions about the exams whenever they'd ask. The class wasnt difficult because it was mostly memorizing. I always felt super guilty about my exam grades because I felt that I shouldve helped them study. As the school semester went by, the worse it got. And I just shut myself off, but I'm too nice to ignore them. So everytime I see them, I would smile and remain quiet. I kept myself busy with classwork to avoid talking to them. It was so mentally exhausting. I felt bad about the entire semester and I'd beat myself up over it. I thought to myself that maybe if I communicated better none of this would've happened. Almost everyday that I had to wake up for that class was extremely hard. Every morning was exhausting no matter how many hours of sleep I had. I didnt want to get out of bed and i had to force myself out and as soon as class started, I'd want it to be over with. 
In another class, the person that sat next to me was chill and nice, as I thought. There wasnt need to really talk to each other except group work. I ended up having to do all of the group work and present the groupwork myself while they stood there. I was awfully furious about it but I didn't want to confront them about it or email the prof about it because they weren't doing well in class and I felt bad. Towards the end of the semester, they'd text me and ask me to help them on the exam which I refused because I told them I havent studied for the exam due to the fact that I had 2 other exams going on same day. And in that class, one low exam score was allowed to be dropped and I told them that I chose this exam to be a drop grade. And they'd reply with, ""I'm sure you'll do well even though you didnt studied"". Like...ok?? And when I didn't ""help"" them out, they eventually moved seats next to another person which I was totally fine with.

Sometimes I wish I was more confident in myself and others. I blame myself for things like this happening to me because I allow it. I have no control over it but at the same time I do in a way. 

I fear this semester may be the same and I dread it."
I cant wait for my 19th Valentine's day alone!,"I thought I'd finally have a partner for valentine's day. She was my first girlfriend I celebrated my birthday with and I thought shed be around for Thanksgiving, Christmas, new year and valentine's. However that's not the case. The case is she left me for another guy and is now pretending we were never more than ""acquaintances"". Why do I have to be alone for ever holiday I never did anything to deserve this loneliness bullshit."
completely broken,"I don't know where to go from here.. I'm lost and completely broken. I have nobody to talk to. I'm so fucking lonely. My life consists of working a miserable job that stresses me out and makes me so depressed but I dont want to quit because than I have to find another similar job due to my lack of intelligence and education, also I have horrible social anxiety so starting a new job would kill me. I miss being a kid. I remember being a kid thinking ""I cant wait to be an adult, it will be so great""... well here you are kid, cheers. Keep drinking yourself to sleep and hoping for a better day, that's the adulthood dream you always hoped for right?.. I dont know how long I can keep living for the people who love me."
I just want to cry,"The past month has been too hard on me. All of this happened in the same week and has been affecting me since. 1) My boyfriend asked me if I was in our relationship for convenience. I love him and told him I was in it for him. I thought I showed him how much I appreciate him but then he said that we aren’t having sex as much as we use to and he was getting concerned. We have sex nearly twice a week. 2) I almost got fired from my job cause I ended up taking the fall for something I didn’t do 3) the same day my boss tells me she wants to talk my mother tells me we are putting my childhood pet down (she had a stroke and was suffering greatly)

I just feel like shit. I was diagnosed with depression a little over a year ago and thought I was doing better until this started. I just feel like minor things are piling on top of all this as well and I just feel alone. I had an anxiety attack earlier and almost passed out in the shower. My anxiety attacks have been getting worse and more frequent. I just want to have one day without all this shit"
I feel like a burden but don’t have the energy to change,"I know I shouldn’t beat myself up but Sunday’s are always difficult for me, and I can’t help but feel like an absolute burden because I slept all day & haven’t cleaned my room and my roommate has to live in this space with me (she’s great and never complains but i still feel so useless) and my family is paying for me to go to school and yet I haven’t studied at all this weekend... all I can think about is how I feel unlovable and I just want to sleep the day away :( was diagnosed with depression 6 years ago"
Most of the really depressed people I've ever met were also some of the funniest and brightest. Why is this?,"I've suffered with pretty severe depression most my life.  I'm in a particularly brutal spell at the moment.  But thinking back on it all, people have always been shocked when they find this this out, as I am ""very smart"" and ""funny"".  I'm not in the slightest trying to pat myself on the back, because I think as most, if not all of you know, your self esteem is a basic zero when you're in the grips.  But when I was reflecting back on all the people I've known over the years, including 2 that committed suicide, they were always very bright and funny people.  Are we too smart and we feel too much?  And humor is the best coping mechanism within our reach?  

If this is the case for many people, I guess I'll take solace that I'm in good company.  Some of the most interesting people I've ever met had the deepest levels of depression."
I'm seriously considering suicide,"So basically I realized how awful life is, I don't want to be here a long time. I'm planning doing it in a way it's not a burden to my family, drowning in the sea with low chances of recovering my body it's the best I can think. I'll leave them some letters so that they know they're not responsible and it's just me (it's always me).
That's it, just wanted to said out loud"
If i can't reach any goal in my life then i should end it,
So numb I can't even cry,"I feel dreadful, everyday is so fucking tiring trying to be who I want is fucking tiring, I wish people could atleast see that I'm struggling, that if I fail it's not just because I couldn't be bothered but that even living feels impossible. I've literally asked to get therapy and been ignored, I don't know when I'll feel again our how I'll cope, it's just hard I guess"
Self sabotaging,"Throwaway, because reasons.

Realized I had a crush on someone last week. At first, I decided I'd be outgoing towards them and try to make my feelings clear. Then I was actually with them, and decided to not say a word, ignore them completely, and isolate myself as often as possible. Naturally, this led to them talking to someone else all day on Friday and I could hear them laughing through the cubicle wall.

Huzzah for self sabotaging. I give up. (:"
So I officially give up on myself,"I don’t even see any point to anything anymore. Nothing I say or do will ever matter to anyone so why even try? 

So that’s it I’m just.....done

No I do not want to end my life I just want to be left alone because that’s all I deserve."
Would diary journaling help with depression memory loss?,"We all know that a symptom of depression/anxiety can be memory loss. It’s one of the most difficult things about depression because you lose your train of thought mid-sentence, it creates brain fog and you just can’t seem to think straight, it’s hard to talk about things that have happened in the past. I know I’m not the only one that suffers from this because depressed people mention it all the time.

I was thinking, would writing down your day be beneficial for your memory? Write every single little thing that’s happened, like I ate “blah blah” for breakfast, I said hello to Steven today, I played games for two hours today and then maybe read it before bed. Almost like a mindfulness exercise. 

I’d be happy to hear any ideas if anybody has any because I’m sick of not feeling like I’m present in the moment."
Suddenly crying,"I was laying on my bed last night like every night hinking about how undesirable and unwanted I am. Wallowing in self pity and hatred. While i do this, I never cry, but for some reason the tears suddenly hit me like a fucking truck. The pent up anger and frustration kinda exploded i guess and it felt really great for some reason. I am now doing my nightly ritual of hating myself hoping to cry again."
I feel empty,I've tried to fill my life with things I enjoy and for a while it works but they always lead to disappointment which only makes me feel worse. Even going out with friends can stop the feeling for a bit but the moment they leave the empties sets in again and I dont know what to do and I'm getting tired of trying. What should I do
What’s the point anymore,I can’t talk to my friends about being suicidal. My therapist sounds like a fucking robot when she talks to me. I feel like I don’t have anyone in my life who really cares and wants me to feel better. Everyday I’m getting closer and closer to suicide. These pills don’t work.
depression is evil,"it makes you hate yourself. I was a fairly happy kid but now, I just look in the mirror and it makes me want to cry. shit isn't fair"
Losing My friends,I feel like im losing my friends when each day passes by. Even if i have hung out with them recently I feel separation after we go home. I feel the separation getting bigger and bigger. If i lose them i think im going to fully lose my self to depression.
Seeing Tomorrow,"This might be kinda long but I [22M] think I may be clinically depressed but I've never talked about it to anyone, even my brother whom I'm really close with. So I'm a junior in college and I don't have many friends and I've been single for the past 5 years. In general I'm a very quiet person to be around and I don't like it when people stare or keep staring. Usually I just stay in my room and lay in bed, even when there's people around I don't feel like going out. I've been sleeping alot too and getting tired. Idk I guess it feels like I'm dying inside, I'm not suicidal, it's just a feeling I have and I don't like it. So what are your thoughts and how do I go about getting help? Any responses would be greatly appreciated, thank you."
"""Functionally"" Depressed","I feel as though I am more ""functional"" than lots of people with depression (that is, going to class having semi decent grades, keeping up with my hygiene etc) and that makes me feel guilty. I think part of it is not really being diagnosed (well, in a way I have, just by filling out one of those routine mood sheets at a physical. Thats was a whole other breakdown. I dont think I count that as a real diagnosis though.) and how I sometimes don't line up with all the symptoms of depression. (like I still cry a LOT, even in addition to feeling empty a lot of the time) I feel like I ""save"" my depression for the weekend if that makes sense? However recently it's definitely been seeming into more facets of my life and lowkey getting out of control. Like how can I, an able bodied cis white-passing mostly straight woman really have depression when people have it so much worse than me? I think that I'm just melodramatic and a shitty friend, not someone with a real mental disorder.
Sorry for the ramblings (and parenthesis)."
For people in therapy: what could your therapist do to improve your sessions?,A lot of patients tell me that their therapists lack empathy sometimes. Which I think can lead to therapists being judgmental or neglecting the actuals tools and exercises that people really need for improvement. What could your therapist do to be more empathetic or do to improve your sessions?
I hate Monday's almost as much as myself,"It's 5:25am. I've slept for about 3 hours (not unusual for me, I have sleep issues), & now I've got to drag myself out of myself & drag myself to work for 8 hours of minimum wage monkey work. I hate Monday's almost as much as myself."
i hate this,"i hate so many things right now i don't even know what im thinking anymore. i hate the way people act, how we're so mean and cruel, how we always disagree and hate based on stupid things and how we always fight. there's so much fucking sadness in the world and i hate how big of assholes so many people are. i just talk to the girl in my head, she changes a lot but is generally pretty much the same. i imagine the same stupid scenarios that are realistic enough for me to tolerate but fantastical enough for me to actually enjoy. none of these things will ever happen but i don't care it makes me happy"
stuck,i’m the only one who has no clue what i want to do with my life. the things i wish i could do i know im not good enough for and i honestly dont even think ill be alive long enough to even have to deal with figuring out what i want to do. life is so hard and its like i wanna keep going but every once in a while i realize im really not okay at all. im just really distracted and sometimes when i get really sad i scare myself because i 100% feel like im going to hurt myself and i dont want to. i want to have hope that things will come together but ik they wont. so im just living .. and patiently waiting for something to change because i dont want anybody to be sad if i leave. but then again i always wonder whether i will be genuinely missed if i was gone. i wish the people im trying to stay strong for knew that im living for them. but i dont want them to feel pressured or feel like their actions need to make me happy.
Can't open up,"My friends keep reminding me that I can message them any time if I'm feeling sad so they can talk to me about it, but deep down I know that I just can't.

There are one or two people I can actually open up to, but even then I just get scared that I'll eventually drive them away, or they'll get fed up of hearing about my problems. Even though it's much harder dealing with things by myself, to me it's better than dumping all of my issues onto another person. 

I want to be happy - just feeling good or even alright the majority of the time would be enough for me. I'm actively trying to get outside, and take care of myself by getting dressed, showering, and cooking proper meals, but some days it feels like a lot of effort just getting one of those things done. Some days I don't do any of those things, but it's never because I'm too lazy. It's because I don't have the physical and/or the mental energy to do so. It makes me feel so weak and pathetic when getting out of bed feels like a chore. 

I feel like I have to complete a mental checklist before I can think about talking to someone about how I feel. When people have found out I haven't gone outside yet, or had a shower, they assume that once I get those things done, I'll instantly feel better. While I understand where they're coming from (outside means fresher air, showering means you don't feel gross), it usually doesn't make any difference. To be honest, it makes it harder to open up to people when I feel like I have to have done certain things before I can reach out. 

I don't know if anybody else feels this way, but whenever I take that step and reach out, in the end I end up feeling like I take another two steps backwards. Once I open up and talk about my struggles, there's always this overwhelming sense of regret that comes afterwards. Even if I feel terrible and I desperately want to tell someone and ask for help, it always feels like there is something actively stopping me, and I hate it so much."
18 year olds with Grammys,"I have clinical depression and I’ll have “flare ups” when certain topics come in to play. One of those is successful people who are my age or younger than me. I’m 22 I’ve lived longer or the same time as them. Time was fair to me and to them and I didn’t take advantage of it. I hate when people say “oh you’re still young.” I’m the oldest I’ve been. My body in pain and my anxiety crippling daily function. My hypochondria destroying me. Death feels a lot more comfortable than this. There are kids now doing more than me. I’m not looking for comfort for my state or advice. I just hate living year by year. Maybe it’s a neurological condition, maybe it’s psychological, maybe it’s a psychological condition caused by a neurological condition. Either way I don’t care for anything anymore. My virginity is raw, my life penniless. I’m just tired of this mess. 

Kids are now overtaking me in the fast lane. I think I’ll just pull over and stop. My car has been broken for a very long time anyway and running slow."
Another post,"Everyone  is currently tweeting, life is short so appreciate it and eveyone it in. Ik I have people  that care about me, but a check in would be really nice rn. I'm sad I cant even say it anymore cuz I feel burdened and tired right now"
i don’t know,The only reason i don’t kill myself is because i don’t want my family to have to pay for anything because i know they won’t be able to afford anything. Also i don’t want to leave my friend stuck with doing our senior project alone. We’ve already done half of it and i don’t want to put all the work on to her.
i have nobody to talk to,isolation is going to kill me
"Sick, alone and just broken","First I'm not a native English speaker, and not at all active on Reddit or anywhere else for some time.

A few things about where I'm coming from - I'm 25, I'm a student, I moved to France for a good education and a better life, my family was and still is poor, I got very sick out of nowhere and now I don't see the point
in trying to carry on.

Since this summer I wake up with a swollen face and fingers, I have always a headache and a pain in my back that rarely goes away, also I have a very hard time remembering things, learning new things, even talking to someone is hard because I don't remember simple shit (seriously, sometimes I forget what I ate for breakfast, I'm not even joking).
Sometimes my dick isn't working, and i have trouble peeing, shortness of breath, and weakness...

Doctors say it may be ckd among other things, it's a long story.

My girlfriend left me, this time forever, i also liked someone else very much after that, and I lost that too, because I wasn't thinking straight, I wanted to explain everything, but you can only explain when someone wants and needs your explanations.
And at some point I just lost the last bit of hope.
Loneliness is killing me.

Sometimes I can't stop crying, and I don't know what to do.

I feel like I lost everything, and I can't fight my monsters anymore, I think about life, and what makes us wanting to live, I think it's hope and maybe love. But something broke inside me, there is a thought inside my head that gets under the spotlight more and more often, and it's saying that there is no escape, and I won't have a normal life, not tomorrow, not after one month, not ever...

So, why even try, why go through all of this, when hidden in this fog are only deception and pain.
Sometimes I want to just die in my sleep, to not feel all this pain and these emotions, I don't even know why I'm writing this, i wasn't always like this, I guess I'm just weak...."
Have you ever been too depressed to even hurt yourself?,"I’ve got no energy left in me at this point. 
This morning I was all excited about something in my life that could possibly make me soo happy, but then it kind of backfired and I’m embarrassed and I’m tired and I’m just done. 
I’m just done and I don’t know if it’s part laziness or the lack of energy, but I don’t even think I could reach for anything without passing out and falling asleep. 
I’m just too tired"
I don't know anymore,"This is going to be all jumbled up and probably make no sense, but there's too many thoughts in my head and i can't seem to organize them anymore. There are days where I've been getting better, then there are days like these.

Everyday it hurts. It hurts that I disappoint the one I love. It hurts that one day he'll probably leave because i'm too much of a fucked up mess. Anything I do just upsets the people i love and I don't know what to do anymore but cry, crawl into my bed and think about whether or not I should start hurting myself again (though I haven't selfharmed in a long while) and sleep hoping to never wake up.

I want to be better, I really do, but it's so hard it almost seems impossible. No matter how hard I try, it's never enough. I'm never enough. I'm getting tired again, i can feel it, and that terrifies me."
Everyday is so painful. I’m trapped.,"I’m suicidal and medication and therapy has not helped. I will kill myself if I’m sent to a hospital because they have and will break me into a million pieces again. I’m just trapped, and there’s no one I can tell but the internet because at this point, only the internet can’t send me to that hell. This is such a cruel world."
Can't handle my moods,"So my moods are all over the place and can go from good to bad really quick. I'm overall getting better after switching meds but I still fall into dark places pretty quickly sometimes. My problem is I use getting animals to feel the voids. Recently I've been setting up new or redoing current enclosures to suite the animals more realistic environments. My problem is that when I use the animals enclosures as my ""escape"" it's the only thing I focus on and I kinda neglect other responsibilities which my girlfriend then picks up my slack and is getting overworked. How do I go about fixing this? I'm not looking for quick fixes because I know how I am and I need something I can get into slowly at first."
Anger,"My first therapist was fixated on the fact that I never get angry. 

Well now I get random bursts of outright rage. I can control myself if there are people around me. But if I'm alone, I scream. I throw things. And I'm so helpless. She took everything from me, and even now she finds new ways to make my life hell."
My life is a lie,"I tell people that “I’m fine.” Even if I tell people how I feel, I almost never say the full extent. I never tell people that I am dissolving, and liquefying; morphing into a pool of nothingness. I never tell people how utterly hopeless I am, because I don’t want people to lose their own hope. I don’t want to lose my friends, but oddly enough, that makes it so that I don’t really let them be friends. Time has gone by at an eternally slow pace, and yet it can’t go any faster. I am both horrified that I will be old in what feels like tomorrow, and yet hope that I will die today. I’m a living paradox, and yet I am not truly alive. At least if I was alive, I would have a purpose."
Why do I feel so alone,Let’s start out saying I haven’t had the best life. But that’s not really why I’m here. I just don’t know I’m trying my best. I got friends I got a decent job I’m doing decent in college and I have a girlfriend but I still just feel alone. Like even tho I have people I vent to and talk to I still feel alone. I just have this feeling that no one cares when I know they do and I see that they do. I don’t know why I feel like this and it hurts me more and more knowing that I’ve went through so much in my life just to feel like this just to feel Alone. I hate it. Especially today I basically stayed in bed and slept most the day I ate like usual and worked on some homework but today wasn’t the same for some reason I just felt really alone more then usual. It’s really hard for me to explain this but maybe I just was expecting more out of life I guess. Maybe I’m just overthinking like I tend to do but I haven’t broke down and cried like today in a long time. The past hour I’ve been listing to some songs I really connect with and just crying after doing the usually cute goodnight stuff for my girlfriend. She really try’s to help to when I’m down I know me and her have grown distant the past awhile but I know she’s trying and it sucks because lately I’ve been feeling so alone. And she can’t be there all the time which I don’t blame her and I’m glad she’s doing good with her life ( we do live together just we both been working and with school it’s hard to ever do anything more then just see each other in the morning and night) but I guess I’m just worried my life is just gonna keep feeling like that I’m alone I’ve talked to a few of my friends to night and it helped for a little but idk why I feel so alone still like why am I crying. I have a decent life with friends and family what more could I need ya know? Idk idek if I made any sense but I just needed to rant and hear some opinions anonymously I guess idk
Please,"I really need to talk to Someone right now, anyone available ?"
Trying to hold it together,"I've been struggling with depression for years but my kid being born seemed to change my world, at least temporarily.  But now with the cost of daycare my family is constantly struggling.  We are broke again for line the 500th time and have no food and I wrote a couple checks that I know will bounce but I needed my meds.  My dads dead and when I asked my mom she turned it into a huge lecture and just got me even more depressed, she never lent me the money.  I just feel like a failure to my child and spouse, no matter what I do I feel like there's never enough money.  They deserve a stable life and I'm not giving that to them I applied for a second job and it should start in February though.  I just hope you God we manage the next 4 days.  I'm just so ashamed and embarrassed."
I want it to end,"I'm so done with everything. I feel like everything just gets worse and worse.

I've lost all connection with basically all of my friends. I never had any connection with my parents. I'm going to fail half of my classes. And the few reasons I had for not killing myself before seem to just be disappearing

My girlfriend left me 2 months ago and she was the only person I've ever felt like I could make a connection with. I used to not want to hurt my friends or parents with my death, but since I've lost connection with my friends, and learned that the relationship I thought I had with my parents didn't actually exist, I'm not too worried about hurting them anymore. And the last reason I had was that I thought things would get better with time, but I've been saying that for 3 years and things have only gotten worse since then

I honestly don't know if there even is anything that could help me anymore"
i can’t do anything,"i have no motivation to do anything. i can’t even play video games anymore and that’s the easiest thing to do. i can’t do things i like. i really want to but i just can’t and it sucks and i know it sounds lame and i should just do them but i genuinely can’t. i’m not trying to procrastinate on playing fucking video games for christ’s sake, i don’t know what’s wrong with me and i can’t.

every day feels so long. i dont do anything fun anymore. i haven’t been eating a lot because i just can’t. i’m so lazy and i feel awful about it. every noise just drills into my head and i don’t know anymore.

yeehaw though i guess :)"
Things are going bad again?,"I had a few things good happen to me and i kinda wanted to ""savor"" the good news for myself before I shared it to my friends. In the span of a week, I dont want to share it to anyone and now I dont even feel good about it. I try to be open w friends but I'm relly feeling/closing the ""closing people out"" action .         

I wrote in alot of my college essays about my future and my ambitions and I had a good few weeks in December feeling motivated. Is actually  didnt have a single thought about dying or feelings really burdened and I got into a few colleges as well. But everything  feels bleh now and I'm subconciously scoffing at the fact that no one can tell, frriends/family/college admission poeple, how I'm really feeling and my changes in my thoughts."
"Roommate moving away, nothing left"," My roommate is moving out of the country soon, and I don't know what I going to do when he's gone. I don't really have any other friends besides him, and without him my only social interaction will be work and counseling once a week with my therapist. My life feels pretty lonely and meaningless as it is, and idk if I'll be able to handle it when he's gone. At that point I'll just have my cat and that's it.

I've been in counseling for this depression and social anxiety bullshit for my entire adult life - 12 years now. It's never helped with anything beyond having someone to help with problem solving for specific situations I needed to figure out. I've never had any long term or even short term improvement of my symptoms. 

I've tried different counselors. I've tried sticking with a counselor I felt comfortable with for a longer period of time, at least until my insurance changes and I can't see them anymore (Remind me again how great American health care is again?) I've tried different approaches to therapy. I've found antidepressants that help, and I've tried plenty. Antidepressants can only get you so far, though. At this point, I just feel like I don't have any options that could have a chance at  offering me anything better than what I have now. 

Honestly I just don't see this ever getting better. Sure I'll find a friend or two here and there through random chance, but they never stick around. I would bet anything of value that i'll be more or less in the same place ten and twenty years from now, not that I have much of value to stake on such a bet.

I just want to stop feeling like this..."
:):,~at this point I just need someone to talk too.~
What’s the point?,"I honestly have been feeling like crap for at least 5-6 months by this point, and I never once had a suicidal thought. 

Until today. 

It’s 10:00pm where I am and I’ve been sick with the flu for less than a week, yet I don’t get any sympathy for literally not being able to get out of bed, so why should I? I have 6 tests to take tomorrow, a 5 paragraph essay due tomorrow, and I’ve missed enough days to not even be counted as a student. 

Why even bother? Why should I go to school for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, just to get treated like garbage by all but a few of my classmates, disappoint my parents with my grades, and have it drilled into my head that I’ve never been good enough, am never good enough, and will never be good enough? I already know I’m a piece of shit. 

Why should I go to school to get anxiety and panic attacks, and to slowly have my soul sucked out each day, only to end up working a poor paying, dead-end job despite my dreams of working in IT?

What’s even the point of getting up in the morning? What’s the point of talking to friends? What’s the point of spending time with family? What’s the point of telling people my problems? What’s the point of going to church? What’s the point of taking care of myself? What’s the point of living?"
effort,"today, I woke up and didn't think about suicide. 
today, I woke up and ate a bag of peach rings. 
today, I felt happy. 
but tonight,
tonight I feel alone
I feel sad
and I know that it'll be okay
because I'm fighting this never ending fight as best as i can"
How to be motivated?,"I no longer know if I’m depressed or just bored. Either way, I feel like I can’t do anything, it’s like nothing is fun anymore."
I do not know how to be happy,"It was so easy growing up. Happiness was making others proud of you. I could study and get good grades. I could exercise and perform well at sports. I could practice drawing and improve my artwork.

Now I am an adult, and I understand that I have a very comfortable life. I live in a first world country with first world problems. I think the biggest problem is finding my happy place. When I’m not happy, I walk around with a chip on my shoulder.

I don’t know how to change my attitude or how to change my lifestyle so that I can be satisfied with my life. I’m definitely an entitled brat. I work hard - I’m the sole working member of my family, I take care of the household, but I actually expect something in return, which I think makes me entitled. We all play a role in the family. I chose this family- why should I feel so entitled? 

I feel like a failure. I don’t know how to improve my approach to happiness. Do you have any advice?"
I don’t know 🤷🏻‍♂️ what i can do for her ..,"She is my gf .. sometimes i don’t know 🤷🏻‍♂️ what to say to her when the depression is attacking her ... she says i wanna die everyday .. and she already started in playing with knife, cuts her skin and stuff .. i just want to know what i can do for her in times like that .. because sometimes i can be completely clueless what to do in those times .. i feel afraid and guilty because i’m unable to do anything for her"
I am so fed up :(,I just wish I could go back in time holy fuck. I done fucked up my life so bad. Everything has turned to shit..I have so much stress and what feels like a million problems. I need a big spliff. I honestly feel like putting a bullet thru my brain....
Im tired of trying,"Im trying college for the 4th time, moved on my own so i would live closer to my school. I thought that moving alone would help me finish my college since there would be no distractions (family&dogs). But i was wrong, after half a year i am falling into depression again. I have 0 motivation and i am constantly stressed, tired and just ... empty. I've started having suicidal thoughts more often, even if i try to brush is off. But im too much of a pussy to do anything so dw.

I dont even try to finish my college anymore. Im just turning up to some classes but i know im not doing enough and i will not pass. I have already failed 3 super easy courses. I had to just be present like 4 times but i didnt turn up.

I have fucked it up again. Im gonna get kicked out of my house and i do not wanna move back with my family.

I keep dreaming of disapearing and moving somewhere where nooone would know me, start a new life. I just need a new start...

So so so tired"
How do I stop feeling like less of a human being with a cognitive disability.,I have a processing disorder.  I have an official tested psychologically IQ of 80.  I write ok but I have such difficulty articulating my thoughts without prep time and I can read words fine but I don't retain anything.  Also I can only do math up to a 6th grade level and am awful with grammar like punctuation what an adjective is etc.  I feel like I'll never amount to anything in life and that I'm less of a human being.  I feel so awful about myself and have less than no self esteem.  I feel worthless and don't enjoy being alive.
I'm Tired of Being Stuck,"But each time I try to work on it, I just get more depressed when it inevitably doesn't work out.

Then my anxiety kicks in and reminds me how inadequate I am because I'm not where I want to be in life, I don't have anything going for me, and at 32 it doesn't feel like it's about to change any time soon."
The Reason I Keep Existing,"I feel horrible all the time. Nothing really makes me happy, and I hide in my room and just watch anime or play video games all day. Why am I still alive? That is a question I always ask myself. I started researching ways to kill myself effectively and painlessly secretly.

  But I'm not going to. I'm not going to die. My wish is for everyone around me to be happy. Helping people with their problems makes me smile, and if I have to suffer daily to help other people, then damn it, I'm going to!

 I know people who are going through lots of pain as well, and I try to help them, even if it's not very effective. I'd rather see other people smile because I'm there to crack a joke or trip and fall with comedic timing than have everyone weep because I did yet another thing to disappoint everyone in my life.

So I'll keep going, for my friends, and even people on the internet who know what I feel like every day. Thank you for giving me the will to live."
"Stress, anxiety and depression.","Tl:Dr: The only thing that makes me wake up everyday and work and try to have a better life is my 1 year and a half daughter. Her beauty and innocence melts my hearth. 

I just want to play video games all day and lay in my bed doing nothing. I'm a civil lawyer from a 3rd world country with financial problems and procrastinating issues. My dad literally made me director of his broken law office and I have tons of compromises with clients and low income. 
I have an amazing wife. But my work is consuming me. I hate being a lawyer and I pretty much prefer the hardware technology field. 
I cry almost everyday in the bathroom because I don't want my wife to know. my Debs are more than 10k dollars Wich is a lot in my country. And with me making less than 1500 dollars per month and having to give the best life possible to my daughter, it is really hard to get out of debt. Most of my debt are from credit cards and loans taken to cover my daily basis expenses and bills. I feel empty most of the day but my days gets normally better when I get home and play with my daughter until I have to sleep. I normally stay awake most of the night thinking in business ideas to take my family over and calculating my debt or how I'm gonna buy milk for my daughter. As I don't sleep very much, I'm sleepy for the most part of the day. I don't know what to do with my life.

I feel sorry for my parents.,"I feel sorry for my parents for how I feel. Even though a lot of the times they could definitely be better I still suffer when I see them feeling guilty and sad about my situation.
Does anyone feel something similar?"
Happiness is weird- I don't trust it.," I struggle with depression. I'm always sad in someway ranging from the mild 'WTF am I doing with my life, the world is a bad place' to 'Oh God, I want to die, someone please kill me, I can't do it anymore.' Or somewhere in between.

Yesterday, I did my very first poetry reading and it went really well. It's something I would never have done in a million years because I have a stammer and social anxiety but I just decided to go for it.  People loved it, said it was amazing and I felt really good about myself.

And then I went home, had my dinner and went on my laptop and started listening to a bit of Charlie Puth. And, I didn't feel sad at all. For the first time in ages I felt at peace.  And it felt weird.  As if my depression was going to jump out from behind a wall and  punk me and be like 'Down you go, bitch.'   I don't trust happiness. I'm always waiting for the catch. For the rug to be pulled from under my feet. 

Was I actually happy last night? And is this what non depressed  people feel like?  Can anyone relate to this?"
Most painless way to commit suicide?,"Or how do you make it look like an accident?

I'm filled with guilt and shame and depression that I tried to get rid of since I was a teenager. Nothing is working and I'm just... tired. 

Thank you, you are all good people."
I’m not good enough for love,There will always be someone who is better than me. I’ve never been in a relationship and I’ve never felt love because I convinced myself that I’m not good enough. Having a crush on a girl always makes me feel like the most worthless person on earth. I will never have a chance with this person so I beat myself up. Love seems to come so naturally to people my age. The fact that I’ve never felt it makes me think that I’ll never truly be happy.
I want to kill myself.,"I've been having horrible thoughts for the last few months. It's never been this bad and normally I would fight it off and try to make myself feel better, but I'm beginning to just not care anymore.

I don't have any passions for things I used to do or joy in things I liked anymore. Every day I wake up with the looming thought that one day, we are going to die, and I'm petrified of not knowing where the hell I am going to go, but at the same time am horrified of living on this shitty planet.

I don't want to exist just to perish from a random final destination circumstance or horrible luck or even old age. I don't want to die not knowing if I'm going to see black for the rest of my life or never exist and all of this time spent on this Earth is wasted. My brain is fighting between both of these and I'm just so fucking tired.

But I think about all the people that have died. All the people that were lucky to escape and don't have to worry or fear this thought anymore. The people that have left this Earth and no longer exist not having to have the anxiety or shit that I have mentally that haunts me every waking moment now. I left the house to get groceries and cried thinking I would never see my family again and I would die in a crash. I'm 24. 

I don't want to keep living if my life is going to be just constant fear of my mortality and existance. I feel like dying from your own hand is better mentally than Living through a constantly shifting world of negativity, fear, and hatred. I think dying happy is the best thing to do

So I'm going to drink. I'm going to get drunk, just like my first time  And I'll see if death comes in the form of alcohol posioning or suicide under the influence.

I just don't want to be here anymore. I wish I never existed."
I don’t want to die,I’m really unsure of how to feel. I don’t want to die but I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to feel this amount of sadness. I want to feel something else. I try too.. I try to stay positive but my mind keeps tugging me further under.
Forgot to take my antidepressants and felt better,"First of all I won't stop taking them. However, I forgot to take my antidepressants yesterday and today and I feel alot better for no reason. Correlation does not mean causation however, have you guys ever experienced something like this?"
Can it be night forever?,"I want it to be night forever. Everybody on this is Earth sleeps while I be the one up. So that nobody can see how I actually want to feel/be. Let me be in this endless loop. Let me drive fast on the highway while not worrying about if I were to crash. If I were to, nobody can see me suffer. I want to be were nobody can see me suffer, just like it is at this moment. Next, I wake up in the middle of the road and see my car that's been wrecked. Seeing that it's night so I'm back to the endless loop. I mean that's what depression feels like anyways."
Lonely and sad,"Probably no one will notice it but if someone does, can I talk to you guys I've been feeling really lonely and sad"
I am becoming depressed and irritable at my child and feel like a terrible mom. I don’t know how to get out of this. I struggle to go do fun stuff. I just need a shoulder to cry on.,"I went through a break up  from a tumultuous relationship so it was the right thing to do. Within a month of that ,  I bought a house and moved with  my kid by myselfand had some house problems $$ when I got there.  My family is minimally helpful.  I work a lot at a demanding job many hours and I usually don’t mind doing it all myself and have been for years . I’m Usually fine. I typicallyhave a peaceful existence with my kid but this past month I’m grouchy and irritable at him and feel terrible. I apologize to him each time. I have blown up at the 
Ex husband  who is out in left field with school and times and it affects my kid and I.  My kid is  upset and sides with the dad of course because he’s there. I feel very guilty .  I just can’t win.  I don’t want to date or meet anyone - for adult companionship. I stay in my house once my child- 
Goes to the dads and I mope.   How do I get out of this funk? Counseling has been mediocre help in the past  but - I don’t feel they are helpful to me really.  I’m not usually depressed. It hasn’t happened for years."
Enjoy the little things,"Try to enjoy the everyday little things, things such eating thay frut you really love, drinking some hot coffe while looking at the son or the clouds or even at the rain during your lunch brake at work, listening to your fav song, or even driving your loved car, good night you all, tomorrow it'll be a new day and a new start, stay alive guys, even when there seems to be no reason for :)"
rant,"just a little rant of some sort. so there’s this guy friend that i was really close with, and i used to have a crush on him. and one of my girl friends was teasing him about him and me, and he responded with, “oh fuck no, that’s disgusting.” i’m not sure how i feel about this, because yes it hurts, but at the same time i feel upset because he’s being so immature, because in the past he has never talked to me in that manner. whatever, i’m sort of over it by now, i think i’m just overthinking everything."
Suicide pact with myself,"Without going into too many details my childhood was awful, about two steps up from a child called it. So after multiple mental breakdowns and self harming I promised myself at about 13/14 that I wouldn't kill myself until I turned 30. My rational being that those who've had power over me wouldn't by 30 and I would finally be free and happy and if not... why drag my miserable life on..

The problem is that I've created a very high stakes life for myself where every failure, mistake etc. brings me closer to suicide. And since I'm not progressing as I believe I should the time where I kill myself seems inevitable.

So I'm 23 now and pretty much finished college with the exception of one math class I need. I've failed statistics at least 3 times and decided to take calculus instead, those being my only options for my major. And guess what I failed calculus too.I actually had a breakdown in the testing room and cried over the test for 2 hours until i was allowed to be dismissed. While ""logically"" I know that failing once doesn't make you a failure per se but I can't help but to associate the two. 

I don't necessarily want to die. Ideally I want to be free from this shitty family and live a life of freedom like I always wanted. But I can't this pact i made with myself has taken control of my life and I feel powerless. I don't know what to do anymore."
Depression fucking sucks and I need somewhere to vent,So let me set up my situation from my point of view real quick. So at the beginning of last year I started seeing a therapist bc I wasn’t feeling almost anything towards anyone and I wanted to harm myself on a daily basis. And I stopped going a few months after bc my dad stopped making appointments bc he thought I was ok which I was far from it. If anything therapy opened my eyes up to wounds that I buried long ago. About the same time I stopped going to therapy I broke up with my now ex girlfriend. We had been dating for about a month. When I broke up with her bc I felt like I was putting to much of my issues on her she took all of my friends except like 3 (all of the friends that left were people I’ve known since Elementary school). So as all of this happened I also had to do summer school that turned out to be a huge waste of time. And over summer I became less and less confident in myself and my abilities. I isolated myself more and more. I’d honestly be surprised if I posted this.
I am scared,"I grew up in a family that never really believed in mental health issues and I saw depression as someone being stuck in a rut or just being really sad or upset.

I lived life in a very one dimensional and simple way without giving much to my own thoughts, wants, or aspirations until my senior year of high school.  I felt like most goals that I wanted to accomplish were always in reaching distance up until that point.  During my senior year I spread myself way too thin, and walked from class to class getting shat on, and being lost and struggling to catch up.  I looked towards the internet to help numb the pain of how much a failure that I felt like I was, and how disappointed my family would be of me when they found out that I was a fraud and was not the son that they wanted me to be.  Endless videos, rounds of games, porn, and scrolling through endless streams of reddit consumed me like an addiction to just escape from being who I am from feeling that I’m me and to get away from the reality that is and was my world.  

Up until that point in my life, I lived with a life philosophy that I was quite proud of.  It was to always live life with a smile and try your best to find happiness even in the darkest and worst of situations, since there will be plenty of moments that I lived through that were both worse and better, or even if this moment somehow topped the cake, there is always more to come good/bad, and I should be appreciative of whatever life I’m currently living.  However my normally happy disposition slowly deteriorated to neutral, then slowly to just unhappy or purely apathetic.  The worst part of this was that I was the only one who knew, and I kept up my happy facade because I didn’t want to drag others down with me.

This mask that I put up is something that just kept eating away at me, and pushed me towards the crutches of the internet even further, since that is the only place where I could truly be myself: a failure, a disappointment, filth, a degenerate, unhappy.  This pushed me to the point where I have difficulty doing anything without using internet and entertaining myself in some way or form, even it’s to get out of bed, brush my teeth, washing dishes, at a party, talking to people, doing homework, etc.. I am absolutely addicted to this massive network of entertainment.  Without it’s presence, I become jittery, I get headaches.

At this point everything I was doing was out of necessity, I no longer did things because I wanted to, but because I felt like I had a need to.

College changed me up a bit.  It taught me to think more deeply and critically and made me reflect on my belief system and my motivations in doing things, and emotionally became more developed and learned to acknowledge my feelings.  It really evolved the way I thought and allowed me to see the world in a more nuanced view, and my first year of college was able to snap me out of my stupor that I was stuck in for so long.  I thought it would be the end of something that I thought should have never happened, and that it was all behind me now.

However, it was just on the back burner and during my second year it came back in full force.  I felt completely out of control with my life and don’t know what to do and almost mindlessly just trying to get through each day, hoping that I might reach the same elusive happiness I once had if I just held out long enough.

It got out of control, and I started attending therapy.  My first therapist was very helpful and insightful and it was the first time it felt like all of my experiences, emotions, and thoughts were validated.  I still struggled, but things were becoming more bearable.  We stopped at the end of my second year, since I wanted to try and function with it over the summer.

In the first semester of my third year, it was the first time I genuinely considered the act of suicide.  Up until that point I firmly believed that suicide was a bit of a crazy idea and that things can always get better.  However, at that moment, I felt completely and entirely worthless, something worth less than the air around me.  I was an entity that was better off not existing and I was a waste of everyone’s time and effort around me.  I didn’t attempt it because a friend of mine helped me snap out of it.  I got back into therapy.

My new therapist was a reader of lists and I was checklist of symptoms.  When I talked about myself, she eagerly waited to hear buzzwords before rattling down a tired and winded dialogue tree that was probably practiced several times over.  I was soon referred to a psychiatrist and began taking prozac.

I stopped taking it.  There are a variety of reasons, but the biggest one was to just find the motivation to refill the prescription, and to rely on medication that I haven’t really felt the effects of yet.

This does not mean I gave up the fight, but I’m now trying my best to fight back and build my own path, and try to figure out what I want.  But I cannot undo the damage that I caused in my previous college years, and I’m now at a loss and am genuinely afraid of the reality that I’m forcing myself to live in right now.  I don’t know what to do and how to keep myself motivated when it feels like I’ve already fucked up at the starting line.

I am scared of what the future holds.

I am scared that I will recoil back into my shell if things get too hard once again.

I am scared that I won’t be able to come out again.

I am scared that I’m truly going to just end up as a failure and a disappointment.

I am scared to disappoint the people that I care about around me.

I am scared that I will refuse to stay in reality.

I am scared"
Meds question?,"Sorry if not allowed, but can someone direct me to a good sub (if not this one) for question about treatment?  


Basically, over the years, I've tried a few options - most notably Lovan (Prozac) which I can't really complain about. I ended up coming off it, but my low mood did return eventually.  


Then, I developed brain fog, and a doctor diagnosed depression - even though in my opinion I wasn't at that time. I took Lexapro for that (brain fog rather than depression), but I didn't stay on it long. It didn't clear the fog, and so I moved onto something else.  


That something else was Paxtine. I didn't realise how bad it was until years later when it became apparent I had NO emotions. And when I tried to get off it, the brain zaps were so hardcore, and it actually CAUSED brain fog.   


Recently, I've had a pretty low mood. A combo of being single and away from friends and family over Xmas and New years. But it persisted, and now my ""to do list"" is so long and overwhelming that I just can't even face it.  


I considered going back on Lovan, but apparently it doesn't do much for anxiety, which I definitely do have. Or, maybe I should be considering them separately? But I don't like the idea of being on a ""bunch of meds"".  


So I'm wondering what else might be out there treatment wise? I've heard Wellbutrin might work well for me, but I've read some nasty side effects. My pharmacist gave me a flyer about Brintilex/Trintilex. He said it is often prescribed to people who need to ""stay sharp"". (Who doesn't need to stay sharp?)  


Whatever I go with, it needs to basically help me lift that fog, give me a bit of help with the anxiety, as well as depression, but not dull my emotions to the point where I can't feel anything. I want to smooth out the ride, not kill all feelings.  


Any suggestions? Thanks. :)"
Low point,I really don’t know what I’m going to do about life. I am currently (and will be ~1 or more) physically disabled due to nerve issues and I am supposed to somehow find the motivation to continue college. I have already had to take a medical leave before and all it did was give me more time to have my memory and willpower get worse... just Jesus how do people function in this world and what mixture of drugs do I need to join them
"Finally in therapy, and I’m not doing it right.","For over 10 years I’ve wanted to finally “solve” my depression once and for all, and to do that, the go to answer from everyone is to get therapy. I was forced to get therapy a couple times when I was young and I felt too ashamed/ nervous to open up to them, and quickly quit after a few sessions.

Finally I’ve been going on a consistent basis, and have been prioritizing my mental health for the first time ever, even though it’s costing me a 1/3rd of my measly pay check. 

The problem is, I’ve gone to 8-9 sessions and I’m exactly where I started. I promised myself I wouldn’t lie to my therapist, because what’s the point in that? But I feel like I’ve been lying through omission. 

I don’t mean to do it, but when I’m sat across from someone looking me in the eye, I feel stupid telling someone all my unfiltered feelings. That is, if I can remember how I felt over the week. A lot of times, we’ll do exercises and I can’t really get in touch with how I’m feeling. 

I don’t do the homework she gives me, and each week I leave convinced I’m going to follow it. But I never do. I feel like I’m not putting in effort, and I should quit. But it was so difficult for me mentally and logistically to find a therapist, I’m worried if I quit I probably wouldn’t go back. 

I knew therapy would be work, but I didn’t realize it would be THIS much work. People, and people on reddit especially, like to prescribe therapy like it’s the bullet solution to everything, but it’s not so straightforward. Ultimately, with or without therapy, we have to be the ones to pull ourselves up... and sometimes it feels like an impossible task."
"29, no degree, no motivation, addiction, feel like i missed the boat",I dont have the energy or care to go back to school. I dont know how to give a shit about a career. If i can stop drinking and overcome my compulsive porn use hopefully i can gain the motivation. Just wanna talk to someone
Do you really think we're the ones with the problem or is it everyone else.,They all Fucking go to concerts and work out and pour themselves into their jobs they're all too scared to realize no one is content its all distractions until you stop for a minute and realize you'll never be really happy.
Need post serious depression help!!,"So in my early 20’s I suffered from major depressing (i.e. couldn’t leave my room, w/ suicidal thoughts). Anyway after letting time takes its course and forcing myself to be more social, I was able to get out of that hole.

The main reason I’m posting this is because while I don’t feel depressed anymore, I don’t feel excited about things anymore and nothing feels new. My problem is, I don’t know if this is a normal thing of growing up or if it’s still some effects of depression. I guess I just don’t know where to go from here or what to do. Sure I can live the rest of my life out like this, but surely it isn’t the best way to live.

TDLR: use to be depressed, but still feel like something is missing from my life."
just some problems,"i don’t think i’m sick, or have any mental illnesses but lately i’ve been feeling sort of empty, and it’s sort of hard to describe but i feel like i’m just “there.” i feel so out of it these days, and each day feels so boring, and the same boring things happen everyday. nothing interests me anymore, and i just don’t find joy in things i used to. and recently, whenever i get upset or sad, i just feel like cutting myself, because i feel like it’s my fault, and that i don’t want to harm anything else (like throwing objects or idk) i think this is mostly because of the fact that me and my close friends have drifted a lot, and i’m scared that i will get left behind. i do have other friends apart from them, but we’re not close, and we don’t hang out. i just don’t want to be alone, because it has happened to me before, and i don’t want it to happen again. i never talked about this to my friends or anyone, and i always have to smile and laugh, even though i don’t feel like it, because i don’t want my friends to worry and think of me differently, or somebody fucked up."
So i stumbled upon this song...,"Just scrolling on Youtube to while away my loneliness when i stumbled upon this song. The song is titled ""Sukiyaki"" by Kyu Sakamoto. Curious about it, I listened to it thinking how a song about a Japanese meal would sound like, only to realize how horribly wrong I was. As I looked at the translation of the lyrics, I was so speechless about how it is so relatable to what I am feeling right now. I just couldn't help myself as my eyes slowly welled up with tears. Then to prevent them from falling, I just... looked up, just like the lyrics said. Gosh, I would've laughed right then if I was't feeling so devastated..."

Suicidal/various mental health issues but not seeking treatment because currently enrolled in college. Should I withdraw and seek help despite the ramifications?,"This is my first post here, and I am struggling with how exactly I should express myself and format this. With that being said, I am looking for advice with regards to my current situation. I am currently a junior in college who is going through what can only be described as a depressive episode. I also struggle with anxiety, and I got help with that past summer. Now my depression seems to be getting worse; I struggle with lethargy and low energy and have a lot of trouble leaving bed in the morning. I'm also very irritable and have an extremely difficult time focusing on anything which is extremely problematic considering I am in upper-level English and philosophy classes. On top of that, I've been procrastinating on my studies which is compounding my feelings of worthlessness. I am also having thoughts of taking my own life, and these thoughts have been increasing as of late. I feel as if all my confidence has been removed from my body and soul. I also feel like one of the worst people on the face of the Earth; like I am subhuman and will never truly relate to or fit in with anybody; like I am fundamentally flawed. A round peg in a square hole. And I feel like and fear that I'm on a trajectory that ends with suicide unless I do something drastic, and receive help.

To the external world, however, I am doing great. I am currently working on my resume so that I can apply to Law school and I should be studying for my LSAT right now. I have a small group of friends and am in a steady relationship. I just was hired to be an RA next year in our dormitories. I feel enormous pressure to maintain these appearances, however, and I am also consciously aware that my mental health issues are holding me back academically and socially. At the same time, I fear that I could be setting myself back by taking a semester off (or some other drastic measure) to receive help for my issues; plus I know most people in my life would not be supportive of this decision at ALL. I would be met with derision and scorn, as most of the people in my life have already voiced their skepticism towards mental health issues. My friends definitely wouldn't understand. And I'm afraid I would be setting myself back career-wise as well.

At the same time, I truly think I am slowly deteriorating mentally and may need intervention to prevent me from going down a dark path. I am feeling more and more inclined towards suicide each and every day, and the thought of no longer being alive is enticing. I feel as if it is a struggle to continue and be functional each and every day. Every day is extremely painful, and I don't think I have done justice to the pain I feel in this block of text. I just want someone to be supportive and tell me that no matter what I decide to do, I'll be okay.

REPOST FROM r/suicidewatch"
I Hide And Cry Alone,"I've been dealing with mental health issues for a few years now and attempted to take my own life twice, once when I was 15 and another when I was 23. The first attempt the cord snapped. The second attempt I survived an Overdose of a cocktail of prescription drugs and was asleep for over 48 hours.

When I get depressed I go find someplace quiet and away from everyone so I can cry out my pain but not aloud. I used to try and talk with family and friends but nobody really understands. I just recently got the boot from my home and now I'm couch hopping. It makes me feel like I'm being a burden unto those I speak with and I feel like I annoy them with my feelings.

I've lost many people in my life to drugs, alcohol, suicide and murder. The pain that I feel has got me numb and desensitized to death. It makes me feel better to cry but the fact that I feel alone on this road is a cold feeling. In my mind I'm screaming but I'm trapped. Stuck like a dead doornail.

I don't know where this will lead me but I'm trying to help myself, I'm going to counselling and recieving assistance in job searching by my local outreach workers. I believe that one day I will get better, day by day this pain will go away 😔😑✌

Thank you for taking the time to read this whoever you may be 💔"
I don’t know if I’m depressed or if my mind just going emotionally numb...,"This might be a little long as I’ve written this several times but ended up deleting it but today something happened at my workplace that made me realize that I need to talk to someone about this,


I don’t think I’m depressed but...
Every day, everything is becoming less and less “exciting”. I don’t wanna get out of bed, want to spend my whole day sleeping, don’t wanna go to my classes, at work I just wanna get my hours and go home without even saying Hi to anyone. 
But the main problem to me is that I’m losing my emotions with every passing day. I’ve written about this losing emotion problem several times but deleted it before posting because I think it’s pointless compare to other people problems on this subreddit, but right now I’m typing this at my workplace because I really think I need help or something

I think it started when my uncle passed away few weeks ago and I remember not feeling anything, everyone in my family was around me, comforting me when they told me the news of his accident since I was rather very close to him, my brother kept hugging me and kept telling me “You can cry, it’ll make you feel better”. But how could I cry when I wasn’t feeling any grief, I was shocked but even after a few days every one in my family was sad but I wasn’t feeling any sadness, I even remember faking being sad because my mom was getting concerned about my mental health and I didn’t wanna worry her

And today this girl started crying really hard next to me in the break room and all I did was eat my food and leave. I didn’t feel any sorrow or concern about her.

I’m recently questioning my existence a lot as well and honestly I think I’m alive until now because of my mom, just thinking of how devastated she would be if I kill myself, it stops me from thinking of ending it all

I’m getting over a cold and I gained 3 lbs this week because all I really did was sleep, binge eat and cry. I did get some chores done one day last week. I made myself get dinner with an acquaintance but had just a really mediocre time and wished I was out eating by myself instead. I want more friends, but I don’t know anyone I want to be friends with. I am very lonely. 

tomorrow I would like to:

wake up at 8

have a healthy snack for breakfast

exercise for 30 minutes

shower

do my make up

wear clothes that aren’t pajamas or a sweatshirt 

go to the bank

clean the trash out of my car

make lunch for my long day of classes on tuesday 

work on homework

watch a show I like

get to bed at a reasonable time

just reading that makes my chest tighten up. but I haven’t done anything worth while in a week. all I do is sleep and scroll through my phone. I’m too lazy to watch tv or play video games.. how pathetic. I hate how tired I am, even if I get a full night of sleep. I take 2+ hour naps every day and I’m still always exhausted. 

I am: sad, lonely, tired, anxious. I would like to be: motivated, happy, content. even though I never really have been. it would be nice."
Need something to hold onto? Depression back after a year,"I am 19, almost 20, but i have had depression since i was a young child. I was in the foster system, dealt with abuse and neglect. I was adopted by a family member, and they became abusive. 
But for about a year my depression left, vanished and i was a happy normal everyday person. But for some reason about 8 months ago, my depression came back. And my anxiety 2x as bad as before. I start back on anti-depressants, and they just made me more anxious and had no sex drive. I cannot deal with the anxiety and the depression. I am a nursing student and it’s a struggle to focus on hard science classes and my physical health along with my mental illnesses. 
I also have been having irrational thoughts about finding a way of putting my happiness into something other than myself, does that make sense? Like having a baby would make my life have meaning and maybe make me less depressed? Or doing something impulsive like getting a tattoo... idk is this something that just happens to me, or do other people who have depression have similar thoughts?"
The confessions sub is terrible for venting about depression. People dont care about you there and they want you to d13.,I dont have any support so I vent a lot on this site. Stuff like this is tough  . I need to vent to make myself feel better but horrible people want me to make myself worse. I hate myself so much and I'm struggling right now .
Should I seek therapy?,"It’s getting bad. Like suicidal, extremely down, depression. Some times I can’t take it. I really need help. Should I seek therapy and talk to a professional therapist? Has it helped anyone? Will this improve? Will I finally be able to see hope again? Because I don’t wanna die, but I also am scared to live anymore"
I have depression and I’m gonna kill myself one day,"Hi, I’m 16 and I hate everything about living, my only dream in life is to live for my parents and kill myself after them. However, life feels really unbearable and crazy right now. And sometimes I wonder if I could make it. I feel trapped because I can’t tell anyone, I don’t want to put more burdens on anyone or make them feel obligated for my life, I’m gonna kill myself one day after all. And when I got professional help I was slammed into a psych ward. I hate the fact I’m female and the life I was given I hate being powerless and being built for something I can’t do “have a child”. I cry and I have panic attacks every night. Killing myself is always lingering in my head no matter where I go, and the night makes me want to act on it. I know there’s no changing my mind no matter what. I’ve been through too much and know too much. Just give me some advice or relate with me."
Don't know where to go,"I have Schizoaffective Disorder. Basically this means I deal with the symptoms of Schizophrenia and Major Depression. I was pretty stable for awhile until four years ago my girlfriend at the time broke up with me. Now, I'm not still hung up on her or anything, that's just when my mental health plummeted. 

I'm finally on some medicine that is helping me cope with everything. The voices aren't as loud and almost no visual hallucinations. I'm also on disability  and got a lot more in back pay than I could have wished for. I've also only got this semester left in college and then I graduate.

With all that, I should be feeling better. Things are starting to turn around it seems. But I feel worse than ever. I feel like I'm a failure and nothing I do will work out. I'm not sure where to go next. 

I get my knives back tomorrow because of my good behavior. Deep down I know I shouldn't take them back just yet. I'm not ready to have sharp objects in my apartment. But I want them so badly and I'm not sure if I'll have the strength to tell them not to give them to me."
Fuck,Ever experience true despair how do you recover from that it has broken me and although I’m collecting all the pieces  how do I pull myself back together
Why can't I just be fucking happy??,"I fucking hate myself. I fucking hate myself. I FUCKING HATE MYSELF.

&#x200B;

Why can't my fucking brain just be happy for 5 fucking minutes. I had it. One of my biggest issues in life is constant job hopping. I can never hold a job for more than 3-4 months before my dumbass brain refuses to just settle in. I fucking had it though. I had a job that I genuinely enjoyed doing and that paid well. I worked there for 2 FUCKING YEARS. A LITERAL FIRST FOR ME. I thought I was happy, but then my friend told me about where he worked and about how much more he gets paid for the same work I do now.

&#x200B;

So what does my dumb fucking brain do? It gets unhappy. Like it always does. Like it has for my whole fucking life. 'Oh but <friend> is making marginally more, so this job I have now must suck' and I let it sink in. I let it affect me. I fucking took my friends job offer and here I am 4 months later MISERABLE. I hate everything about this new place. I hate the people, the culture, the environment. It's like something out of Office Space. This is the most soul sucking job I've ever had. But I'm making 5k a year gross more now. Whoopdeefuckingdoo. 🎉The only trade off is I now work in cubicle hell and staff parties aren't parties anymore, they're just places people go to try and jerk off upper management to get a fucking promotion.

&#x200B;

I loved my last place. I finally felt like I was really starting to kick this awful disease that I've been fighting with for over a decade since it's manifested itself. I knew people. I was socializing. I was getting to know and care about coworkers. I was starting to hang out with a few of them after works because they where genuinely cool people to be around. I would actually go to staff parties because they where actual parties. I was starting to not only know who I worked with but the families of the people I worked with.

&#x200B;

But the fucking nanosecond that someone shines a light on something that's not even really an issue my brain decides 'NO THIS IS TERRIBLE WHAT ARE YOU DOING, YOU SHOULD BE MISERABLE AT ALL TIMES.'

&#x200B;

Last time I went home to see my parents I tried to explain to them that I would rather get hit by a fucking bus than go into this miserable job for another day. To which they respond 'oh it'll get better! just work there for a year!' and then they had the fucking nuts to comment to my wife about how tired I looked and made an off comment about how it must have been a rough week at work after I walked out of the room to get a drink. Fuck you idiots. I just got done telling you about why I look so miserable but as always you refuse to fucking acknowledge that depression is a real disease DESPITE BEING FUCKING DIAGNOSED WITH IT BY MY DOCTOR.

&#x200B;

FUCK YOU BRAIN. LET ME BE HAPPY FOR 5 FUCKING SECONDS.

&#x200B;

I am so fucking done. I just want off this fucking ride. I hate this life and everything in it. No matter what I do or how much progress I make my diseased brain is going to figure out a way to ruin it for me. There's literally no point in even trying. Everything is dogshit all the way down. Who even cares."
Procrastination,"Day 3 of trying Justified to get out of the depression. Just cleaned my entire kitchen after 3 weeks of doing nothing and some dishes piling up. Ended up making hot dogs because I didn't want to mess anything up. 

Tomorrow I'll try to cook something."
I just accepted that I have depression,"Hey /r/depression,


Pretty much as the title says. After ignoring signs for years, I finally accepted that I am depressed. It's scary as hell and I have no idea what the future holds but idk, I feel liberated. 


Needed to tell someone, and this seemed like the right place."
Will it all be okay?,"I keep trying but it’s like no matter how much I try I just keep getting pushed back to where I started 

no matter how much I try and progress I end up back at rock bottom 

Over and over

I want to think it’ll be alright in the end, but will it?

can I actually change and live a full happy life? Or am I doomed to this reality forever... I don’t know anymore :/"
"I’m having trouble just living, I’ve never been depressed like this before.","In the past I’ve been depressed but it was different I could still function. I wake up and have a hard time going to work, school, eating, but not sleeping. I have insomnia but now all I want to do is sleep all day everyday. I’ve always been able to battle depression by just pushing through with help. I feel like I can’t push anymore. Suicide doesn’t feel the same, when I thought of it, it used to be a way to feel something and to deal with my sadness and anger. Now it just feels easier than living it’s very hard to not think if I died I wouldn’t have to do this. To clarify I’m not at a high risk I’m just tired I’m stuck I need help out of this I feel so tired. How can I help myself?"
I feel isolated and I have no idea what to do.,"The last few years have been rough for me. I moved to the USA from Europe around 4 years ago and since then I have felt more and more isolated as the years go by. I am a native English speaker so that is not a barrier for me. I have just found it to be extremely difficult to meet and socialize with people my age here in the US.

I have anxiety issues from my time in the military (USAF) and I have sleep issues due to overthinking. Weed used to help me a lot, nowadays it still helps but not as much as it used too. I had a bad encounter with edible weed and since then I get more anxious the more I smoke because I keep noticing my heart beat increase which gets me nervous because when I had the edible my heart rate was at 183. 

I get this weird feeling a lot where I just want to leave what I am currently doing and hit the road for a year or two and just be free and travel. I currently go to school but I don't really like what I am doing (Computer science ) and I feel like its a chore to attend classes that I have no interest in even though I love computers and code in my own time at home. I just dislike all of the math courses and physics courses that are required. I have thought about doing a job like a police officer or park ranger but I feel too afraid of making a leap of faith regarding the police role and afraid of not earning enough money if I went the ranger route. I have a love for the outdoors and a love for helping people but I also have issues with doing things that don't spark my interest because I get bored quickly. I am at a point in my life where I feel little worth in how I spend my time or my current lack of discipline and direction. I had a few years of my life where I had this grand plan and it all worked out pretty much as expected but since then (leaving the military) I feel directionless, almost as if what I thought I wanted to do with my life (Software Developer) is not actually what I want to do.

The past 2 months have been very hard for me.I got with a girl back in August. My now ex-girlfriend got pregnant a month ago and it ended up that we didn't really know if I was the father or not because she had un-protected sex with other guys. She ended up getting an abortion. This hit me pretty hard even though I am pro-choice I found it hard to think about. I still don't think I have fully accepted that I could have been the father but I just don't really know. I broke up with her after all of those things occurred because she just was not the person that I thought she was and as much as I still had feelings for her I had to let her go for my own health and well being. 

Now a few days after we called it of, I am getting the feelings of isolation back again. I have been alone in my room for a lot of time the past week and I go back to school tomorrow. I am going to try and hit the gym again this week and also go back to a board game event that takes place weekly near where I live. I want to spend this year rebuilding myself and trying to find avenues to socialize. 

Any suggestions on what I can do to combat this feeling of isolation?

Any ideas for things that help with feeling isolated?"
"Feeling empty, alone, frustrated, and Used","Hey there guys, this is my first post ever, but also I'm just using a throwaway account bc I really just need to unload and maybe you'll get it? The problem is I don't know if I'm actually depressed, do I feel unmotivated, hopeless, generally apathetic, and then stressed out by feeling apathetic? The answer is yes.

You see I already feel stuck in life. I was the too-stupid-one in my family to not be impressive enough to get scholarships (solid B student through all academic career). I was too busy working earning money in the summer in crappy-retail jobs or clearing out gen-eds at community college in preparation for the next semester and expenses -so I never interned somewhere important or impressive. Now as college comes to a close all I have to look forward to is moving back into my parents house. All I have to show is a general business degree and experience in crappy retail work.

My parents sent me to this over-religious private school where I immediately knew I did not fit in (but they gave me the ultimatum of either being assisted with student loans or being kicked out; I chose the former).  
Per people's advice, I tried changing my attitude and undoubtedly self-pitying mindset. 

Feel alone? Went out and started socializing with people and even started a regular gaming group.   
Tired of being single? Joined a dating app and met up with matches.  
But despite all of that, the dating, the ""putting myself out there"" and getting people to like me, I feel even more bitter, cynical, and apathetic than I was in the first place.   


I hate these supposed ""friends"" who have started inviting me to join them for lunch and etc. outside of my gaming session. Why? Bc they only want me around bc I'm entertaining enough for them.

I hate online dating bc all it is just jumping through hoops to impress the person, and convince them you're both an interesting and complete-enough individual to be ""serious relationship material"". 

I think of what I have as ""dancing bear syndrome"": I'm only accepted and liked for what I can provide for people. And honestly I'm just sick and tired of it. But again, I also I just feel deeply upset that I can't just say ""fuck it"" and be happy with being alone. So then I put myself again and again through the motions of doing things to please and get-along and ""connect"" with people. 

And I'm just getting to the point where it doesn't matter who I hook up with, I'm just mildly hoping I catch something that will give me cancer and end my life short. Suicide is too much work to think up and actively take a part in. But at the same time, I'm putting myself in more risk-taking situations just hoping I get jumped and killed, or run over one dark night... 

I just feel so done with everything."
"I need advice, but not exactly for me....","I’m not sure if this would be the right subreddit to ask for advice, so before I make the actual post, I would like to ask; would this be the right place to do so? If not, what might be a more suitable subreddit?

Basically, I would like to get advice in order to help a good friend of mine who very well may be going through depression (again). Once I share the actual story, it’ll make more sense, but since it isn’t the actual post, I’ll try to summarize. He has been going through a lot of hard times for the past couple years. The most recent one (which he has been currently been trying to figure out and I have been giving advice/emotional support to him for) has stripped him away from most likely all the other friends he has left. Now, I am not a stranger to depression; I have gone through suicidal thoughts, self harm, anxiety, wanting to run away, the works; so I so far have been able to understand his pain/dilemma and have been giving advice/support through my experiences. In fact, the person in question unknowingly saved me from my pain. Well, he knows that I had felt misunderstood, was lonely, and had a dark past myself, but long story short, he doesn’t know yet that without him giving me hope, I most likely would have ended it all. Anyway, he is also no stranger to depression. 5 years ago, he had an even darker past compared to what he has gone through recently, to where he had suicidal thoughts, tried running away multiple times, and used to cut; but states he no longer does these things. 

To wrap up, lately there are a few things he said over text that make me question  if he is starting to become depressed again. The current situation itself is complicated; I so far have been able to give him advice, but, if the situation progresses to where we both currently are fearing it might, I am afraid I might run out of advice to give. Currently, I am the only one who knows the true severity of the situation at hand, and most likely the only one who knows about everything else he had revealed in the past week. Thus, making me the only one able to help him so far. If this does grow in severity; not just talking about the actual situation, but his possible current state of mind, I would like to encourage him to get help. I may have been giving him advice lately, but we are both just sophomores in high school. I am not a certified counselor or anything like that. That does not mean I will back down from helping him; I want to do the best in my ability to support and guide him. But, if it comes to it, that also means for him to seek more professional advice/support.

I guess I will also like to add, admittedly I am not the most optimistic person myself. I do my best to show optimism through our text conversations, where it’s the only time that we actually talk about all of this. But, lets just say, that I am better at giving optimism to other people than myself. Now, I am not completely a pessimist. I do believe he will get through this, and that he will become stronger than before. But, lately, I have been plagued by the “what if’s”, since it’s only been getting worse. If we were to talk about this in person, especially if this gets/he feels worse, I might not be able to keep my composure. It’s not because I feel burdened by what he has told me, but rather, I worry for him. Unfortunately, I am naturally pretty sensitive, and the last thing I want him to think is that he shouldn’t “burden me” anymore with his situation. Even trying to explain this to him in person would most likely bring tears to my eyes, causing more confusion or strife.

...So, as I stated before, this isn’t the actual story; more of a very summarized version. Would this subreddit be the best to submit the actual story in order to hopefully get advice? Or should I visit somewhere else, such as an Ask-subreddit or the like?"
How can I stop thinking about sex all the time? Help,"I have felt the same way for the longest time and to be honest it sucks. I don’t know why I have this problem either but I feel disgusting. Even at the most inappropriate time with the worst kind of people. When I look at them I think about having sex with them. Then I try to make the thoughts go away. I tell myself stop it, that it isn’t right! But the thought still comes back in my head. I know based off of my thoughts that I’ve made horrible decisions. As in I’ve had sex with horrible people. I know I can do better and I know I’m worth more but I still do it. I feel Dirty and unworthy of any real relationship with genuine love and affection. I just want to have sex over and over. So if anyone knows what would be the best course of action or any way of getting help. Please let me know. I don’t have much money but I can’t keep feeling this way it makes me feel worse everyday."
birthday blues,"today is my birthday, but i hate it and i just want to die. this year’s birthday was horrible for me, it just reminds me of how different things have become. people who i were close with weren’t close anymore, and it just hit me more when they didn’t celebrate my birthday (surprise party or messages/stories on social media) i might be sounding superficial, because friendship cannot be measured in the amount of messages or stuff but i’m saying this because the previous year, my birthday was a lot better, and it actually seemed like i mattered. but this year, nothing happened, and i just feel so sad and irrelevant. i feel so small and insignificant, and i just want to disappear. i want to hide in a hole and fade away, and i have this urge to hurt myself, but i’m scared of the pain. i hope tonight will be okay, i don’t know why i’m typing all of this so i’m sorry if you read up to here. i think i just needed a place to rant and express my emotions. have a great night everyone:)"
"Wanting to die is such a natural, fleeting thought for me that it’s almost like remembering I need to add an item to my grocery list.","Sometimes it hits heavy, other times I’m driving in my car on the way to work thinking “I wouldn’t mind if I was dead right now”, and then continuing on with my day. Or cooking and thinking “Damn, I’m so tired, life is exhausting” then going on to add more seasoning to my food.

Death and life is a constant chore and reminder for me. Always on my mind, but I’m so sick of drowning in it that it comes and goes in such offhand ways when doing normal everyday things."
Fruit can help somewhat with depression,I have experienced this myself and I think it’s because the brain requires glucose and healthy sugars to cool itself off from inflammation and other stressors. I’m not sure if most people here ever have fruit but try and have a good amount everyday and see if it helps. Supplements like Magnesium and Thiamine are really good for depression too because they can help address the different causes like Oxidative stress and Methylation issues. Make sure to do your research and do a lot of it there is a lot of great key information about how to really treat mental illness online.
I feel guilty,I find it hard to be happy. Every moment of happiness lasts for a very small amount of time. I think about suicide every once in a while and then i think of my parents and it makes me wanna cry. It makes me feel guilty or ungrateful because they have tried the best they could to set me up for a happy and successful life. I know they love me very much and that just makes me feel worst. I know they think i am happy and they probably don’t have even the slightest suspicion of how i really feel and i feel as if im lying to them. I don’t know how long i can do this. I really hope that i can get my shit together before i do something that would break their hearts .
Depression slump for over a month...,"(BACK STORY)
I went to a substance abuse rehabilitation program in November.  After coming back, I lost my job, served (now 2) eviction notices, tried the 1212-step program; but was betrayed by my sponsor. 
(CURRENT)
I've been crying basically all day, no appetite,  watching Netflix or YouTube, have no friends after rehab. No hobbies, not crafty. My brain feels like a mess. I don't know what to do anymore."
I could use advice anything helps,"My friends are leaving me ,  I either can’t eat or over eat I either can’t sleep or just stay depressed all day , I don’t feel comfortable talking to anyone , my family tries to hide it But when anyone gets a temper the fact I’m a disgrace comes up , I am so depressed and my windows of happiness get smaller and smaller I just feel so empty and need advice I don’t know where else to turn to therapy hasn’t worked I’ve gone to therapists , doctors and consolers . 
Any and all advice you can give would be amazing ,Thank you"
I'm really not ok right now.,"I know it'll pass, it always does. I know a lot of my current episode is due to life changes, the season, and just my normal hormones. I know this will most likely go unread and that's fine. I just feel so defeated. The intrusive thoughts have started up again and I have to catch myself, remind myself that it's not worth it and in my heart I KNOW this. But every once in a while it's just.. it's hard. Life is hard right now, and the world is a scary, disgusting, and dark place. I know it'll get better, but for right now it's not. And if you read this, thank you."
what is your MBTI?,humor me and post it if you please. i´m an INFP.
I suppose I just want an escape.,"I guess I just like the idea that, there were gonna be some moments in my life where I could let my guard down, and just be okay. Knowing that's true is probably one of the most painful things about my life right now.

I just want an escape."
I feel empty inside,I don’t sleep anymore. i can’t even cry if i wanted.  People always say “I’m here if you need someone” but no one can truly understand my pain
You're not worthless.,"Just because we feel hopeless doesnt make us worthless, sometimes things got too hard so then we start to cope-less.

So let's face this together and show the world who we really are, sometimes you have to feel like a dumb rock before you're a shooting star.

-sleepy <3"
On the verge of cutting for the first time in a year,I’m struggling and been thinking of cutting again for the past week and I was talking to my boyfriend so he could help me not and it was going good till he brought up his ex that passed away and said he misses his soul mate and that just made how I’m feeling so much worst and all my other friends are asleep but I don’t want to cut help!
Feeling bad,"I don’t really know what to expect from writing here, I just feel like horrible, and I imagined there could be a subreddit about depression. sorry if my English is not the best, but anyways. I have been fighting with my parents for the last couple months because they found out that I smoke weed, I’m 19 years old and I study in another city close to my mom, (my dad lives in another city, they’re divorced) but currently I’m staying with my mom because I’m still on vacations. Today I got into a big fight with her because of weed and she told me to leave the house tomorrow. I really don’t know why I’m writing this here, people has bigger problems. But I’m really feeling horrible, and lonely. I’ve felt depressed these months and today it just got worse, I really feel like I’m a waste of person and I don’t know what to do. I hate this sensation of loosing everything and be alone feeling like shit. I can’t even smoke weed, because I feel guilty and don’t wanna cause more problems. I feel like an idiot but I wanted to talk to “someone” without judging me."
What triggered your depression?,"Sometimes depression and anxiety are simply genetic without any known direct cause. In my case, depression and anxiety both run in my family but mine was “set off” by a toxic work environment. I have always struggled with self esteem and confidence since I was young. Without going into too much detail, my last boss was horrible to me. She went against district protocol to do whatever she wanted. She blamed me for things that had absolutely nothing to do with me and gaslighted me into believing it was my fault. I actually found out that this involved another person but she lied to blame it on me. She also micromanaged me to the point where I was having panic attacks. I resigned from that job and this happened two years ago but I still feel hurt by it. This woman’s treatment of me haunts me sometimes and I cannot fathom how someone could have such little regard for another person. She triggered my depression. I went from a woman who hardly ever cried to crying at the drop of a hat and wanting to die. I did recieve therapy and continue to take medication but it still hurts me. My confidence is a level zero and I want it back (what little I had). 

Can anyone else relate? What triggered your depression?"
When I die...,"No one will see it coming.

No one will be given a warning.

No one will be reached out to

In any other way than to just...

...be given a nudge, to see if...

They're really there...

Or not...

And that's all...

If even that...

Because it won't be thought upon for long.

It won't be drawn out.

It will be simple.

It will be as simple as going to the fridge,

Walking outside,

Starting up a car,

Taking a sip of water,

Pressing a foot on the gas pedal,

Pulling back on a trigger...

&#x200B;

Without thought.

It will be a split-second decision.

If I myself have any warning,  
it's not like I'll have known for long.

It's not like I'll have enough time  
to inform someone even if I wanted to.

And I don't... I don't want to...

My death is mine; it's not yours.

It's personal.

If I had it my way, there would be no body.

I'd simply disappear and be done with you all.

Fairly alienating sounding, I know.

It's not personal.

And you know...  
It's not personal...

But... Someday...?

Someday, I might actually prefer a stupid decision  
to the alternative...

&#x200B;

I live for myself, largely, but us humans, we are social creatures,  
and (alienating again, I know) I just find that I become  
disappointed...all too often...

and find that I do not feel  
as empty...  
as desolate...  
as hopeless...  
as disappointed... ... ...  
in this life...  
in people...  


And then I realize how little chance there is of that, upon writing it... The next line I'd be tempted to write, for the sake of being poetic, would be ""not as disappointed in myself""; however, I find that I am not disappointed in myself...  
Others make me want to believe it is myself I am disappointed in, but I am not. I'm proud of who I am, what I am, and we largely have no control over *what* we are... I'm finally alright with it. I don't have any real complaints. The only thing I am disappointed in myself for, at all, is having hope in people, in a humanity that I long ago chose to stay away from for a very good reason...

I do not mesh...

I don't mesh with humans.

And I no longer care if I sound alienating, because you, reading this, probably shouldn't feel that way. I'm not thinking of you. I don't know you. For all I know, you're actually alright. The people I've had the pleasure of meeting, however, are not people I am very proud of. I see a lot of love, a lot of compassion, a lot of hope and even will to be better, even be the best... But they fall short in such great ways that leave me so perplexed... It looks so easy from here. Judgmental, yes, but I've taken time to think... I know of many places where I myself am lacking. I understand it because I'm me. It's easy. For others, I have to take more thought. If I don't understand it, I can't speak of it as if I do, and therein lies the problem — I do understand it... They speak loudly enough, both with their words and their actions. And they show me that they are aware...fully aware...of what they do, how they do it, what they can do to be better for themselves and thus for others as well... And they falter... They falter on purpose. It's intentional and it's knowingly.

I wouldn't be able to live like that.

And... After being around people like this... It's brought down my own will as well...

It's hard to love someone who doesn't love themselves.

It's hard to be convinced by them that you are stupid for wanting to analyze them and life as a whole with the intention of fixing it...so convinced...through repetitive action...being ignored as a means of punishment...and then, in the end, to be told the very thing that they need to be told...

""You can't love another until you love yourself first and foremost.""

There are many ways I agree with this quote.

The main way that I disagree is when it is said towards me...because I know, inside, that I very much love myself. I can even have an ego. And it isn't out of compensation for a side of myself that I hate. I used to hate parts of myself, and I chose to fix those parts. I came clean. I became an honest person. I started to live with integrity...

The second way that I disagree with this saying is because of my experiences in life... I have found that I have felt some of the greatest love I have ever felt in life from some who have not loved themselves at all... They hated themselves... And yet, they loved me with their all. They would never stop short of showing me it each and every day. It wasn't needy. It wasn't compensating. It was a genuine love and a full love...

I'm not sure why I write like this anymore. I'm not going to impart any ""wisdom"" or knowledge to anyone because it is knowledge that is only applicable to myself and only worth something to myself.

Love is a killer...

Love is blind?

Perhaps...

It blindly swings a knife...

You have just as much chance at cutting yourself as you do at cutting another...

Love is a drug, and I'll take it, watching you sharpen knives, giving me hell, but I take it because I still have one good eye...

Lose that second eye...and you're blind. You pick up that knife, and you're swinging it right back at them. One can only hope that knife remains in the metaphorical realm and doesn't become all too real.

Most murders are a crime of passion. Killing oneself...? Oh, that's the biggest crime of passion of all...whether you love or hate yourself...you're stuck in this physical form...

And some of us just want the fuck out of here...so badly...

Someday...

Someday, I'll make the choice...

I'll take stupidity over pain."
my cry for help,I feel like everything around me is slipping away. Everyone is leaving or everyone is dying. Or maybe I’m just the one slipping away.
The pressure my parents keep putting on me hurts,"I’ve thought about suicide twice, and I know I seem like a happy person on the outside but I cry nearly everyday because they expect me to pay bills and take care of money and act like a damn adult. 

I can’t cry or talk about it at all because I know my parents would get mad and yell at me and just push me deeper into this damned hole of shut."
i dont want to go to sleep because i'll be alone with my thoughts,"i know i should get sleep at a reasonable time or else i'll regret it the moment i wake up, but i can't get myself to lay in my bed because then i'll start thinking and not have mindless activities to distract me. i don't want to think about all my mistakes, my insecurities, how i'm going to die alone, and how much i'm going to be miserable tomorrow just like how i am every day of the week. i love sleep more than anything in the world and i wish i could sleep forever, but i still can't being myself to do it because i'm too busy trying to keep my mind occupied. probably going to delete this later, just needed to rant in a place where no one will probably read this and it will get lost in countless reddit threads. i'm fine with that, i dont really care, i just dont know what to do with myself."
I Have Fucked Up Please Help,"Closeted Gay Guy suffering from what I have now realized is Clinical Depression and I believe it is Severe. I am 20 and a sophomore in college. I believe my depression stems mostly from extreme social isolation and the pain of being closeted. 

At my school, most of my classes my first year and a half were online, which rendered it very isolating for me. I pushed though however albeit being miserable. A year ago at this time in January 2019 I would have denied it if someone accused me of having depression. 

This past Fall of 2019, things got worse for me as I moved off-campus and I think that just increased the aura of isolation in my life. Even though I hated my freshman roommate, I did not feel quite so ALONE all the damn time.

Clubs haven't really worked out for me, and it's also really hard for me to go out and truly do the things I wanna do or invite people over because I live with my sister who I am not out to. Obviously dating and doing things I would Wanna do would out me to my parents though her and I am so terrified of that. Since I wasn't genuine with what social life I had from clubs since it wasn't real, I have kind of given up and just hole myself up in my apartment. 

One thing I have wanted is a job but theyre so damn hard to get cause all the good on-campus jobs are hogged by all the kids with connections and all of the off-campus restaraunt/grocery store jobs tend to be hogged by 35 year olds nowadays.

This semester, half of my classes are still online unfortunately so I'd say I am still in my apartment a minimum of 20 hours a day.

My friend back home wanted me to take a gap semester while I work through my issues this spring but I ignored her. I shouldn't have taken on this semester but my parents made me. 

Yesterday, I admitted it to myself that I fucked up and don't think I can make it through this semester. I realized it's not normal to lay in bed awake with a constant negative though loop running through my mind from 11PM-2AM everyday. It's not normally to go every single day of my life up here not having anyone to talk to in person (other than my sister like 5-10 minutes a day but she is too damn busy for me). It's not normal to crave food all day long out of emptiness. It's not normal to be overcome by fatigue and watery eyes/yawning everytime I try to do schoolwork. 

Yesterday, I felt like maybe a medical withdraw for depression was the best option for me but idk. Do you guys think I should try to stick it out and pass some of my classes at the bare minimum- like see what I can do. I have never felt so alone in my entire life as I do right now. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR--- Closeted Gay guy who feels fucked up in college due to depression caused by isolation; struggling to get though school; feels stuck and is considering option of medical withdraw even though that'll be fucking hard"
No point to me being alive anymore.,"*There isnt a single reason anymore, My parents were abusive towards me and hated me because I am lesbian and dated a girl who took her own life two days ago leaving me alone in this hell, I have no friends or any love ones so why should I care about living? I just thought on the chance I took my own life that someone should know they should know I was here but who really cares. I just want to be with her again and see her smile and hear her sweet voice and feel the brush of her lips against mines and hug her tight just one more time and tell her how much I love her and how much I cared,maybe If I did she will still be here.* 

*This pain is suffocating me and is starting to kill me, I started to cut myself to release the pain. Im a failure Im nothing but white noise I need to find peace and I cant find it here being alive, I only find pain.*"
What is going on?,"It seems like everyday it's always something new. Something tragic. I wake up and within minutes of scrolling through social media I see just awful content. War, disease, death, countries suffering. I was really looking forward to 2020, but now all I wanna do is go back. Rip Kobe Bryant. You were my hero."
I can’t fucking cry.,"I just want to cry but I can’t. Does that mean I’m in reality happy, and that I’m just faking everything?"
Stuck,"Life sucks, do I deserve it? Maybe but I’m a better person now. Can I control the past? No, I can’t fix that even though it seems to have turned out ok. I can’t feel a connection with anyone, I want and don’t want to give up. It’s a struggle staying alive and having the courage to commit suicide. It won’t go away, it won’t stop, fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck"
My living struggle,"I'm so hurt, I'm losing hope, I'm a 16 yr old 9th grader i feel ive fallen so far behind in exceeding others expectations I've failed the past 3 years of school barely passing through summer school my run of motivation for trying is completely empty. I have missed the past 3 weeks of school because i can't get myself to get up in the morning it's so hard to talk to people about what I'm going through because no one understands ive told my mom months ago that i need some sort of help, that i can't do it alone anymore but she is always holding it off i feel I'm in an endless cycle of pain every single day I'm home it's the same thing i lay in bed all day and sleep, but im reaching for help with the little hope i have left I'm scared of myself at the point where I've tossed all the meds that i could overdose with so that my mind doesn't talk me into swallowing them. On the school side my mom has told me that it would ""keep your mind off things"" or that ""you could talk to ur friends"". Yet i have so much social anxiety i don't talk to anybody at school i can't even get myself to focus in class anymore. I've also found myself becoming very angry to where I've punched holes in my wall yet i don't understand where the anger is coming from it would just come from nowhere at anytime, i feel so lonely all the time i hardly talk to people anymore. Nonetheless i fear the worst for myself and I'm hoping this isn't my final reach for help."
Feeling stuck emotionally,"I (M31) am feeling lost, recently my ex and I broke up been 3 months already, which is still fresh but at the same time it’s been a while too. Trying to push through and move forward but I really see a beautiful future with her, we both see something happening but now the timing is not right due to work and long distance. We had our issues like all relationships. I know it silly to be sad over this compared to what other people are going through I just feel lonely and feel like iv lost a piece of me that brought me joy and a actual love for the first time. I have moments of sadness where I’m stuck, I would say I’m in slight depressive state and I’m not feeling myself.

TL;DR! Advice on dealing with sad feelings of not having a SO anymore."
journaling makes it worse,"i’ve tried to help my depression through journaling, but writing my horribly negative thoughts and feelings down on paper just make it all seem so much more real. everything i’ve ever written in a vulnerable/depressive state i’ve just had to rip up and throw away because it’s just a reminder that it won’t ever get better"
What’s it like staying in a ward?,Probably happening this week or next.  Pretty anxious about it.  What’s it like?
Non standard therapies,I have been talking to my therapist about trying other options on top of talk therapy (I am on meds and have tried EMDR... neither are helping much). I have heard of the magnetic therapy and was wondering if anyone has experience? Any other non standard therapies that have helped people?
I’m losing strength,Everyday when i wake up for work i look at my glock and give myself another reason why it’s not my time yet. Im 21 now and have been giving myself a reason every day since i was 13 to not take my own life. Tbh idk if i wanna make it to 22. The thought of finally giving up tears me up but makes me feel like i will one day be stress free and no longer angry or sad.
It's maddening how you can do almost everything right and still feel like absolute shit,"Me: ah I feel like shit

Me to me: let's try and change that.

Me: eats something healthy, exercises, goes outside, hangs out with supportive people, cleans the house.

Me: feels no different than if I were to isolate myself from everything at home while throwing myself a pity party.

Me: isolates self and throws self a pity party

And repeat the process."
My parents blame me for my sister's death and I am depressed.,"Hi, I am a Female, 18 years old from Mexico. I am going to a psychologist and getting medication. When I was 5 I was playing on the stairs with my sister.
 My parents had a decoration statue next to the stairs and I stumbled and made the statue fell on my twin sister's head. I watched her die, having seizures. I was just 5 and couldn't do anything to save her. I couldn't move, and started crying. 
My mom was doing the laundry and the sound of the washing machine kept my mom from listening to me crying. When she got there my sister stopped moving. Since then my parents blame me for her death, and tell me I am irresponsible and distracted, and because of that my sister died. 
All of my family thinks in a similar way. One of my aunts told me I am a bad daughter. Last June everyone forgot about my birthday. 
Two months ago I tried to commit suicide. I jumped off my house rooftop, but I only broke my arm. 
I am really depressed. All of the things I used to be proud of myself (my physical appearance, my writing skills and my orchard) are now meaningless to me. 
I really want to be happy. Also I am confused about my sexuality, because I have a crush on both my math teacher (male) and a classmate (female). I know I can't date my teacher, but I can't speak to my classmate either because I am not good enough for her. Who would want to date a depressed girl like me?"
The correct way to help...,"I'm not into depression, but I'm interested to know what depressed people feel, I have some friends that feel this way but I don't know how to understand them for look to the correct way to help them.
I'm upset that the words ""You're only sad"" and ""Try harder"" will NOT work but, how to put myself into their shoes and search for a way to help them on their situation?"
I just cut after 2 years of being clean (TW),"I was in the shower, and I was shaving. Then I accidentally nicked the back of my heel. Today has been a stressful day, so that reminded me of when I selfharmed with my razor. So I sat down and just started going at it at my scars. I did that for 10 minutes non-stop. And I dont know what to do. I dont want to tell my parents or theripist, because last time I did, I got pulled out of school. I also dont want them to worry. I'm so confused and scared. And I just dont wanna wake up tommorow."
The covenant is destroyed,"I [22F] spiraled, fall of last year. I got my diagnosis for the first time. Went to therapy for the first time. Took medication for the first time. But the darkness did not go away. I was involuntarily taken away to a hospital, for a week. 

The covenant were three (X, Y, and Z) of my friends who didn’t leave me when I pushed everyone—all my friends and family—away. They stayed. They visited me every day. And when I got out, they were there for me then. The new year, 2020, had promises of healing. The covenant was pure, honest, and true. It was my motivator, a testimony of my strength. 

But one by one, the covenant got destroyed. 

 X was my best friend, my anchor, and probably THE reason why I am still alive. But he led me on, and took advantage of me, despite fully being aware of my unstable, mentally ill state. Turns out, X had feelings for both me and Y, fucked Y, and basically led both of us on. I have not spoken to Y since the New Year. I feel humiliated, betrayed, and in so much pain. I never wanted to have feelings for my best friend, X, or get stuck in a stupid fucking love triangle, which will, inevitably, permanently tarnished my friendship with both. 

Z this past weekend, in a drunken stupor, told me he was distancing himself from me because he has had people close in his life in similar situations to mine, hurt him. I never wanted to be someone people had to preemptively distance themselves from because they didn’t want to get hurt.  

I have been so unstable but I am trying my hardest to stay afloat.  The darkness hurts my chest and suffocates my lungs. I wish I had successfully died in autumn."
Depression is finally gone but i do miss it,"Hello, ill try to keep it short. Ive had 3 pretty bad years. Was really depressed and suicidal. With the usual stuff too, self harming, drug abuse, suicide attempts etc. However, since like a month or so my 'problems' kinda dissapeared, they just vanished suddenly. Which is great, or that's what I thought. I was always hoping to get better during my tougher days. But now that I dont feel bad anymore life has changed so much. It has improved in some ways, I dont abuse drugs anymore, getting my life back together slowly, college is more bearable and all that. But now it just doesn't feel right. To be honest. I'd rather have all my problems back again. Life rn is good but it seems like a part of me is missing, a part that defined me and made me who I am today. I'm not saying I'd rather still cut or do other dumb things but I miss something. I know I should be happy now, but it feels like my life is 'boring' maybe? It actually feels more like my life is on auto pilot. Day in day out, life goes on and I'm not really aware of that I guess. 
It's like I'm not really living my life. I'm not sure, maybe it's supposed to be like this. It kinda lacks emotion and feelings. That why I'm considering to start using drugs again, benzos I'm interested in. Not to be cool but just to 'feel' a thing again. Like I said, I'd rather feel shitty all day long than feeling nothing at all. Is it supposed to be like this?"
I managed to laugh,"I genuinely laughed, like really hard, with my friends for the first time since spring last year. 

I’m sad they all choose to ignore my depression and suicidal tendencies though. 

Can’t stop thinking that all of this won’t last long and I’ll be back to feeling pathetic and useless before I know it."
Need help with symptoms (booking with a psychiatrist soon) but please just help,"I have spurts of intense destructive anger

I itch all over my body

I have went catatonic 

I hyperventilate 

Heart palpitations (with and without stress)

Dizziness (when stressed)

Extreme suicidal thoughts

Self harm (did it in the past, now it’s come back up)

Lose all care for anything, including my life and safety (ie hitting myself, squeezing things to let out my anger, I.e sharp object which I did today and cut myself (not purposely) and I freak out after but in the moment I can’t control myself)

Scream silently 

Cry obviously 

Whole body writhes

Have had auditory hallucinations when my depression was really bad

Stomach problems when stressed
 
Background

I’m a college aged female

I have a biological parental family member with a paranoia disorder

I have been sexually, physically and mentally abuse for nearly all of my developmental years I can remember and was uncommunicative with everyone from probably 8th to 10th grade 

These come out of no where sometimes, sometimes triggered by small things. Could feel on top of the world in the beginning of the day (I.e today I went shopping for clothes and worked in kids ministry as I do every Sunday and was very happy) also can happen even when life is great (I.e getting a job)

I cannot handle small issues or it could trigger an episode I literally can’t control ( ie someone complaining about something I did could turn into a near suicide attempt which i hate) 

Does this sound like depression or something else, I will be booking with a psychiatrist tmrw I just want to know what to expect, if anyone else has symptoms like these please let me know"
Come to the realization that I’m depressed.,"I haven’t been feeling like myself lately, couldn’t really explain it just not myself. Today I realized that I’m depressed.

My partner suffers from depression and I’ve always been the one that carries them through it, I’ve always been the stronger one, the one that keeps it together and although I’m not in the best place I can’t bring myself to let them know because their dark place is so much darker than mine has ever been. I feel like admitting that Im depressed will trigger them.

I don’t have the desire to do anything, I’m not content being bored but Im not motivated to do anything to fix it.

I can’t remember the last time I really enjoyed anything, the last time I really laughed or looked forward to something.

Im usually the type of person that can find joy in small things, a silly reality show, eating at my favorite restaurant, searching for a good book, but lately nothing excites me or gives me joy.

Work has been more stressful than usual, but as much as I normally would motivate myself out of work related stress, I can’t this time.

Ive had random anxiety lately, nothing specifically triggers it, just will randomly feel anxious and this terrible heavy feeling.

Not sure why Im posting this, just felt like writing it out."
Realizing it's permanent,"I've been considering ending it all for the past few weeks until today. Ive just wanted the pain to stop and to not be overwhelmed anymore and it's felt like that was the only option. It might sound stupid, but hearing about Kobe's death really got to me and made me realize how permanent that decision is.  

I'm still struggling. I still just want it all to be over, but for the first time I recognize the consequences of it and I'm scared. 

No more feeling worthless. No more anxiety attacks. No more feeling like a complete failure. But no more good times (no matter how infrequent they are). 

I don't know what to do, but I can't bring myself to tell anyone I actually know."
nothing feels okay,"i feel like i don’t belong in my body or anywhere at all, it’s like i want to escape but there’s no where to go. i don’t know how to fix this or myself. i wish i was numb, but i feel everything. i can’t find one single thing to live for, i feel distant from everyone and everything."
I know something is wrong.,"I know something is wrong.  My mind is a mess, my days are a haze, and my brain is numb.  I want nothing more than to curl up in a ball and cry.  My plans for my future, both near and far, are put on full stop.  I don't even have the strength to hold myself up.  I want nothing more than to lock myself away, never to be seen again.

Is this depression?  Can I even call it that?

All my life, I've told myself I'm nothing but a monster.  What kind of person makes their mother cry on purpose?  Who writes their mother letters on running away or calling them a hippo... on Mother's Day?  Who sits in a comfortable life and complains about how amazing they have it?  Only an ungrateful monster... That's who.

I went from monster to empty puppet.  I did what I was told, even if I talked back.  I had no control.  I had no freedom.  I felt voiceless, tethered to these strings, unable to break free.  Only to be told that I placed them there myself.  I was the one who tied those knots, yet how come I cannot break free?  Why can't I set myself free?

From puppet to caged bird, I never saw the light of day.  I shy away from the thought of leaving my safe place.  The only place that made me happy, the only place that I could trust.  I hide under hundreds of blankets, hoping to keep the thoughts at bay.  I drown myself in useless hobbies, in hopes to quiet my mind.  

Just as I had tied the knots of my strings, I locked the cage and threw away the key.  A monster deserves to be kept in a cage.  Something so horrible and heartless shouldn't be able to exist among human kind.  Yet, I fear death.  Not once has self-harm been the answer.  I have no scars from pain I've afflicted.  I've never tempted Death by holding his scythe to my neck.  Call it a ray of hope or a fighting spirit, but all I see is another type of coward.  Death without dying.  A life without living...  An empty shell in the corner of the cage with a blank face.

I did this to myself.  It's a battle I've fought for years.  One I've always thwarted off.  Why is it now that it overpowers me?  When have I become so weak.  I've placed myself in a cage for heaven's sake!  Why must you beat me down while you're at it?  All I want is to stop the thoughts.  I want nothing more to do with the words floating in my mind.

*You hurt everyone you meet.  You're the toxic one, not them.  Even now, you're hurting the ones you love as we speak.  Monster... Monster... Monster!*

I don't want to be the monster anymore!  I want to change!  But where do I start?  Where do I begin?  Is there a way to clean up this mess that I'm in?  My mind races more, and I can't keep the tears away.  I feel my head splitting, and I want it to go away.  Keep it together.  You're almost there.  Keep it together.  Your friends are here.

*Friends... Support...*

They give me love I do not deserve.  I wish to give them everything I can, but a heart that cannot love... What can I give?  Money?  Time?  A false sense of friendship?  I'd only be hurting them more.  All I give is pain.  Even if I ripped out my heart and gave it to them, would it even matter?  A heart as black as mine isn't worth a dime.

I know all that I'm doing is throwing a pity party for myself.  I know I can fix this with simple answers.  Exercise, eating right, and socializing...  I do all those things.  I go to school, I study, and I even take hikes.  I go to the gym nearly every day.  I eat healthy, despite the odd sweet here and there.  I have friends who love me and truly care.

*So where did I go wrong?*

I want out of my head.  I want out of my bed.  I want the strength to move on.  But all I get is a bag of regret, and a bag of guilt piled on.  My mom tells me to get out of my head, but how can I when just looking at her face sends me back to that place...  I never look her in the eye.

She loves me, I know.  She cares for me too.  I try to be grateful for staying under her roof.  But I've only done her wrong, and I've only caused her pain.  How can I be happy when that guilt still remains?  I remember the years of pain I have caused...  And now I can't seem to get over this pause.  A pause on life, a pause on living.  

I'm not sure what to call this.  Be it depression, self-pity, or other.  All I know is that something is wrong.  Something is wrong, and I have no way to fix it."
"My life is a living hell and socializing is one of my most painful things to do, how do I increase my pain tolerance?","I don’t like how I look, I can’t accept that I stutter in conversations, I can’t help not being myself around others, I have raging social anxiety that I can’t shake off, and some people keep looking at me the wrong way sometimes. Why are other people the source of my misery? I understand that people are nice and what have you, but I feel sick for no reason conversing with others. I try to change my mindset and it helps, but then I have a panic attack mid sentence when telling stories a lot and I can’t mutter a word it gets so bad sometimes. I’m so afraid of people, yet it’s my life. I don’t think I display my anxiety too much, but fuck it messes with my mind. Should I kill myself?"
I’m so tired and I don’t think I can go through this trial anymore.,"It’s just really difficult. I wish I could change my past. I know some things weren’t my fault and some things were. I just wish I had the power to rewrite it all. I wish I didn’t lie to myself saying it was going to get better. It’s just saddening. To watch my dreams of being ok being slowly crushed under the weight of life. The older I get, the more depressing and hopeless it just seems to be. I never had any happiness or gladness to slowly let me down. It was just sadness and depression and realization of it just gets worse. No matter what I do. No matter what happens. I’m this. And it only goes lower. It doesn’t feel like I can be saved. It just feels like everything delays this.

I’ve felt this way since I was 4. I was having thoughts of not being here since I was 5. I always thought if I was gone, my family would be together and happy and no one told me other wise until I was 12-13. And all I got was bullied and pushed around and ripped apart. I felt alone every single day. Home felt like school. I’m just here to do what I need to do and that was it. I wasn’t meant for anything more. All I was told was get good grades by my mom. I rarely heard I love you. I didn’t get any attention cause everybody was always busy. I felt ok at my dads. Like my sister and my dad and my grandma were there for me. But now my grandma’s gone. And my dad’s working his ass off and I don’t even get to see him more than 2 days every 2 weeks. And now life is pressing down on me, what am I gonna do for a job, what college do I want to go to, what if I don’t make it into college.


And then one day, Allyson came along and I thought, wow, maybe life is gonna be kind, for once, maybe, JUST MAYBE, someone might be there for me. And then I was cheated on, and l felt like the only thing that I thought would’ve cared about me is gone. So I just began to lose it. My feelings. My thoughts. My own sense of self. Because that’s when I just couldn’t take it. I lost all sense of hope. Because all it feels like anymore, is that I’m just meant to be broken.

I have a girlfriend, I have friends, I have family. But what I don’t understand is why nothing ever works. No matter what I do, I feel the same afterwards. Everything hurts the same. The only breaks I get from the suicidal thoughts and ceaseless pain in my head and my chest is when I’m with my girlfriend, but after that, it just comes back. I feel guilty. I’m living with so much pain and damage and it feels like it’s either the same as when it did happen or it’s worse. Why I deserve this, I don’t know. Why do some people get to live their happiest lives and I’m stuck like this. Why do I deserve to be this thing. I just want to be a person again. I want to succeed, I want to be happy, I want everything I used to dream for, I want to be what I used to always dreamt of. I just want the past back. Why didn’t I get to enjoy anything, why did I have to be this. What the fuck did I do??? Why do I have to suffer like this.

I’m just really, really tired and I’ve cried every night for the past few weeks. I just wish I could end this, but then I’ll hurt everyone else, and everyone already has their own problems.
I just don’t know what to do anymore."
It’s that always present feeling of being isolated from everyone and everything that never quite goes away,"Even when I have a boyfriend and people in my life with who I consider to be my friends, I just feel alone and disconnected from everyone and everything."
What happens?,"What should I expect if I walk into a crisis center? I need help...I know I do. But mental health is a joke. Most psych offices have a 6 month plus wait for new patients. I’m to the point of thinking about suicide quite often. If I walk in to a crisis center seeking help, will someone talk to me right there and then? Will they try to keep me there?"
Advice on antidepressants,"Right so throwaway account obv 

16 yo male in UK who is considering going on antidepressants, going to doctors tomorrow to ask for them 

My life is pretty good objectively, i go to the gym, have friends, am relatively attractive and have a healthy sleep pattern and diet 

Am going to therapy in a couple weeks but I want to do something that will help now 

Only thing is I don't feel any other emotions other than anxiety occasional (due to OCD)

Firstly - Do you think i will be able to be prescribed them 

Secondly - Will they allow me to feel things again 

Thirdly - How bad are the side effects (I know they can different for everyone)

Any advice welcome!"
I just wish I could be stupid...,"Not know any better about how miserable my life is.... I wish I could just exist and not have to worry, not be constantly in dread and panic...."
I shouldn't have even woken up today.,"And yet here I am.

I tried my very fucking hardest to get out of bed today, using all of my focus, effort, and energy into going to a study group for an exam which I couldn't study for this weekend because my head was all fucked up.

I get rewarded with the review information and the realisation that I am beyond fucked for this exam. I'm trying to clear my head and keep studying for it using this review guide but I can't. I've started to think about hanging myself if I fail it. I feel like I can't fucking do this anymore. I'm losing my mind.

I'm getting buried in this deepening hole because my brain refuses to work the same way it once was. I don't expect any pity, empathy, or even compassion because I know people will say I did this to myself, but I still feel I have to get it out there because something will break soon. My head, an object around me or my fucking life.

I hope I choose the right one."
I made a little comic for those suffering a loss.,"https://i.imgur.com/x4Wg8oH.png

Maybe it doesn't convey exactly what I wanted it to mean but I hope it isn't taken the wrong way. I miss my parents and my best friend so much, and it will never completely ""heal"" but time does make it easier."
Well...,"It's been a few months of being on meds. What I've learnt most importantly throughout my time was I am able to distinguish when and when I'm not feeling depressed. I've suffered with depression ever since I was 12 and only now I am able to tell whether I'm depressed or not. It's crazy the thought that I was so use to being depressed and that I thought it was normal.

I still want to kill myself though."
I'm scared,"I've been trying so damn hard, man. I've been doing my best and forcing myself out and trying new things. I've been trying to be a better person and I've been trying to be nicer. I've tried to look at myself and change myself for the better because I know that at some point I've gotta do it. It's like cleaning your room. I've been working so hard.

These past few days, the work was harder than it usually is. Right now, it feels crushing. I don't know why I feel so broken. I don't know why I feel like there's nothing I can do. There's gotta be something.

I don't wanna go back to feeling how I felt. I wanna keep working and trying. Why is it so hard to right now?"
everyday sucks,"recently I was sent to live with my dad because my mom couldn't ""control me anymore"". she meant she couldn't get me to stop doing drugs and I wouldn't stop running away. I feel terrible about how I treated her but it was because the drugs were the only way I could escape how I feel on a daily basis. The drugs took over my life, im even staring to take them here now and I don't want to stop. but im so scared to get caught bc everytime I get caught I just sink deeper into this hole of nothingness. everytime they're disappointed in me I feel so terrible and empty, yet i don't know how to show them why I do it and can't stop. every single day I think about killing myself and how everyone would be better if I wasn't here. I sometimes wish I would get late stage cancer (I know its horrible) and just die. without having to make my family find my body and have to live with that memory. its the only solution I can come up with. sometimes I could think about how life will be when I turn 18 and I fell hopeful, but then I get scared that nothing will be different after I move out and ill still feel like this and I lose hope again.I used to be so HAPPY and funny and I really liked myself, but now I just see myself in the mirror and feel disgusted. I cant even let myself be happy, idk how. I can't go anywhere without getting major anxiety. I wish depression was a curable disease. maybe it is, I wouldn't know bc the one time I got on prozac I barely took it because I seriously doubted it would work. I want to go back home to spend my senior year with my mom and my best(and only)friends but I don't want her to still be disappointed in me. idk I sound stupid at least I know no one will see or read this. duces"
Depression and love ?,"
Hi all! I’m new to the thread and I came here to see if anyone can relate to my story, or if anyone can provide insight as to how I can go about handling everything correctly. Im a almost 22 year old female in love with a 23 year old tortured soul. As dramatic as that sounds, that’s how it’s been for the past year and some months. Before getting into our relationship, I was unaware of his depression, he didn’t tell me the extent of it for fear that I would run off. I haven’t. And I won’t. In fact, for the better part of our relationship he expressed that I HELPED his depression, I took him out of him mind, of our the darkest parts of him that wouldn’t let him function. And I was proud of myself for doing so actually. Then came the worst year of my life, with school and work and family all caving in on itself, I turned to him for support. Like an angel, he was there when I needed him. Then things got bad, I couldn’t be the light that kept his depression away during the tougher times, I didn’t have any light myself, this caused us to not be able to go to each other in our darkest times. His depression got worse, I only felt more and more alone. Things got worse before they got better. I’ve been growing, bettering my situation. I have found the light in myself finally, and now I want to help him find his. Sometimes we can be really great together, only for something to happen in which he says something to upset me or disappoints me in some fashion and things get lost in translation and we try to talk it out .. but it’s too late .. the depression hits him. The man I love is gone, and what’s replaced him is the worst thoughts, the worst things to come out of his mouth. What causes it to come back and hit him hard is a situation that he is unable to fix in the moment, and my own feelings getting the better of me and me basically popping off. See, he can be the best man in the world for maybe a week straight, bring me lunch, say all the right things, the there for me morning and night. But when we go through one of our rough patches, that man is gone. And the fact that he can’t fix it in the moment makes him go so far from me that I don’t know how to bring him back. To the extent where he tells me he wants to be alone, just alone. And it’s happened before, and I’ve been the one to guide him out, and he’s told me how grateful he is for it, how grateful he is that I stick by him. But sometimes the depression makes him say the most awful things, and it affects me. It’s like from one day to the next he’s a different person. I’ve never met anyone like him, as amazing as him, yet also with this illness that he is suffering from. I’ve found that music helps, affection as he is slipping helps, but sometimes I’m not even capable of that myself. And that’s when things get really bad. How can I help him when he’s so far gone ? It can last for about a week, maybe more if I don’t do anything about it, before I see the man I love back in his eyes. I know I should give it time, but how much ? The depression has caused him to leave me for my own good before, only for him to say it was the worst mistake he’s ever made. And I’m not going to let it happen again. I want to help him, grow with him. We both have things we need to work on, I know, but I’d like to know if anyone who’s currently with the same thing can shine a light on how to go about things when we’re at this point. Whatever disagreement we had is in the past, I told him it’s not worth seeing him like this. My priority is to help him come back to me, because I know that it doesn’t let him do that on his own. Sorry for the long post but thanks for reading :)

Tl;dr : loml has depression, sometimes triggered really bad when our relationship gets rocky, how can I help without him telling me there isn’t anything I can do. How can I get to the him that’s trapped inside the darkness ? The emptyness ? 

Thanks again !!"
How to start this...,"I haven’t been so low since I was 18 and I am not handling it well. I found myself standing in the shower the other day, crying and saying to myself “You should just die, I wish I could just say” without really thinking and then surprising my self by knowing that I actually meant what I said. 

I feel anxious all the time and I am not sure what is causing it. I feel like crying all. of. the. time.

I was fired from my job in August. I felt awful there so it wasn’t so terrible. I thought that I had fallen in love but he’s manipulative and lies about the most basic things. Apparently he was in a relationship when he got with me. I haven’t had the best love life, been cheated on a lot and I feel stuck in this and that I can’t get out. Every time I try to break things off he somehow convinces me not to and I end up hating myself  even more afterwards. He’s not a bad man... but I don’t know, it’s hard to explain.

I feel so lost. I feel like the best thing would be to die. That way I can’t be burden anymore. I am 30 years old and I still need financial help from my parents. I have debts that I can’t for the life of me pay off. It’s a vicious cycle. I have no friends. I have pushed them away by being difficult. I have no one to talk to about my problems. I feel like a horrible person who takes horrible decisions. Selfish. So ... so selfish. I think I am trying my best but I am not sure that’s actually true. Liar and an asshole. How did this happen? I used to be such a sweet girl who cried when she lied. Which is maybe a little extreme but I used to be very sensitive. And am still, but not about lying. I wish I wasn’t this sensitive. 

And I think that this is now official a rant.

Thank you for reading, if someone did. Makes me feel less alone, believe it or not..."
I'm not gonna make it to 16,
How to hide scars,Hello i have on my left arm scars that you can see good and i dont know how to hide them. Yes i could wear a hoodie every time put in summer it would get to hot for me. Is there something like a hoodie but for one arm you know what i mean? I dont want to use make up. Thx for reading this
What am I supoosed to do with my life?,"I have a job, I make money. My life should be totally fine.

But then again I know I have no friends, I know that no one likes or loves me. I know that my job doesnt make me happy, the things I buy dont make me happy, my life.. is.. boring and meaningless.

All I feel is loneliness, helplessness.. I feel as if nothing I ever did or ever will do has meaning.

WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO BE HAPPY?

I want my life to have meaning, I want to be happy, I dont want to die, knowing that I died for nothing, that my death doesnt have any meaning. That's my biggest fear."
Guess I’m a fag..,"First off. I’m gay. I was delivering pizzas today at my job and I was running out of gas so I stopped to get some and the pumps were going super slow and to top it off some frat boys in a Jeep drove by, called me a faggot, and parked on the other side at the store. I waited and thought about it and I got super mad with myself that I wasn’t doing anything so I said fuck it.. and walked over to their window to see what the problem was. Out of all four of them.. none of them looked at me, they all got on their phones looking down. So I walked back to my car and the one guy rolls down the window and says “can I help you?” And I told him he’s a skank ass pussy. But somehow it still bothers me being called a faggot like that.. no provoking or anything. Just. Pumping. Gas... I’ve been thinking about it all night and I’ve also been thinking about telling my straight brother I’m gay.. we are close.. but he doesn’t know.. I just don’t wanna tell him and he doesn’t love me anymore. Honestly being straight would make life so easy."
I don’t “feel alone”. I am alone.,"I’m in “the prime of my life”, I’m in college, surrounded by people my age all day every day. Yet I do not have a single friend. I think people assume I’m exaggerating whenever I say that, but I literally do not have one friend. I haven’t for years. I don’t click with literally anybody. I’m mad at the world because of this but I know that it is also just my fault. Doesn’t make me hate my life any less, and I don’t feel as though it is in my control to change that. Imagine the effect *years* of being completely alone has on a person... I think it’s hard to fully appreciate how detrimental and traumatizing this really is. Feeling hopeless, really. Always."
A short confession,"I wish everyone would stop talking about Kobe Bryant dying. 

Because, honestly, I’m jealous. Of anyone who dies. I’m jealous of them for making it out."
TW First time cutting,"TW!!!!!!! 

&#x200B;

Today i cut my wrist for the first time. I bought a piercing kit last week to pierce my friends belly and my septum so i ha a lot of sharp needles left. After piercing my septum i realised that i didn't feel any pain and it gave me a sense of relief that i longed for. Today i was sitting in my dorm and i had an urge to try it out and see and it liked the feeling so much that i went at my wrist for about 30 minutes and now there's so much blood but me being the so called perfect  person i am i cleaned it up properly and wrapped it good so no one could see. I can't let people know what i've done to myself. My family would be so disappointed.  I like the feeling but i know it isn't good for be because i'm the type of person to get addicted easily. i'm currently really lightheaded after losing blood but i kinda like it"
I’ve officially just given up and I have a desire to screw my life up and make it as miserable as possible.,"18 M I used to be normal I guess. Then I got into a relationship and I was abused in every single way possible and forced to do sexual actions or she would go to the police. Saying I assaulted her. She destroyed my mind completely. I have zero trust in women and I’m fairly certain their all malicious on some way. Got out of it but a about 6 months after I’ve just been spiraling down hill. I used to be fit now I’m out of shape and have Chubb. I now hate myself and my body more than ever every second of every single day. Maybe she was right. I am a worthless, ugly, out of shape piece of shit. I deserved all the abuse I got and probably more. I have found absolutely nothing that interests me in life and I’m completely lost for my future. I refuse to take medications and therapy because I’m meant to suffer. I’m really good at hiding these things because I don’t want other people giving a shit because it’s not their damn business. I work at a dead end job washing dishes at a fucking Cracker Barrel. I have zero talents or skill sets. I’m literally useless and taking up resources.  No I don’t want to hear your bullshit cliches on just be happy or try to work on yourself and get help... fuck that. It’s weird but now I just want to see my life spiral down further and further and I want to suffer and make my life as miserable as possible it’s literally the only desire I have now. I have extreme social anxiety and it prevents me from doing most things.(not that I would anyway) I’m probably just gonna spend the rest of my hopefully soon numbered days just loathing and praying that I just get taken out quick somehow like in my sleep or something. I just don’t deserve the right to experience life and be happy. Thats permanently burned into my brain now. God I hate that I was born. I don’t want your pity or your cliches I just wanted to type how I feel every day so I can stay reminded Incase I forget."
Relapsed in my depression today trigger warning**,"Trigger warning***** 
I cut myself today after so many months of doing so well. Trying to better my mental health. Getting back to the gym. Back to eating well. Taking my meds. I feel like I failed myself today. Like everything I did wasn’t worth it. I don’t expect anyone to respond. Just really sad at the moment."
Just worried,My sister called pert and tried to have me put in the hospital for days. The reason for this is because i didn't tell her my problem which she has in the past told me if i am not comfortable i don't have to. She threatened me again with going to my dad who tells me to kill myself since no one would care. I was able to lie and say i was fine and they believed me which was good since i get worse rather than better. Now she said we are all having some talk when her husband gets here and now i am worried on what will be talked about since she has betrayed my trust many times talking about personal information to random people even. While she says we will talk its more like they will take their anger on me blame me for things i have no idea on and make me feel like it is my fault everything happens. Just a few more months so i can join this transitional youth adult programs i think that is what it is called and they will help me live alone away from all this screaming. Also my dad lives in mexico i has born here and have the papers to prove it just the threat is to send me there.
I need someone to help me,I need someone to talk to about my mental state right now
Emotionally wrecked,"I've always been such a stable and happy guy.... I was never popular but I managed fine... 30 years old... Managed to have 3 companies... 3 girls... This last one.. It killed me... I don't date for dating... I need a connection with someone... And she needed it too..  
Or so I thought.. I was building something with her.. My love growing... Only 6 months and she felt under too much pressure...  
I never realized anything... She forced herself into being a relationship while not being ready.   
She didn't blame me.. But she left.. She needed time.  
I gave her time... But I though she would eventually be ready.  
Instead she broke up with me by text on my 30th birthday.  
I was not ready.   
We are Co workers from different stores.  
We still need to see each other or call each other sometimes for work purposes.  
I cannot move on because she is there even if not in the same store or city.  
I cannot move past this..  
I had so many dreams hopes and things planned with her...
Apparently I was too romantic... Her words..   
But in a way I feel like I didn't have a conclusion to this.. I don't feel I closed the book.. She didn't express her feelings...   Nothing... I did my best and it was.. Either not enough or too much...   
I cry.. I have nightmares... It's been almost a year... And I feel like I haven't moved on..  
I'm not suicidal... I just... Lost my motivation...   
I can't find it again...  
Can't move past this... 
Just wanted to share..
Thanks..."
I don't see the point in being honest about my feelings with my family if all they will do is be angry at me for feeling the way I do,"The title pretty much explains it. I don't understand the point of being honest with anyone if people give you dumb answers regarding the way you feel. Yeah they might actually care and that's their genuine answer, but perhaps I don't care about their dumb answer. I think I've become basically just numb. I don't want people to know how I feel because they just act angry towards me. What goes through people's minds. I could understand frustration because you feel unable to help me, but people act angry towards me. I don't want to ever talk with my dad regarding my mental state if all he does is be angry at me.

Edit: Thanks for all the support and compassion, I thought I was an idiot for feeling this way but lots of you guys experience the same! I wish you all the best and hope things get better for everybody <3"
“You’re unlovable”,"What’s wrong with me... I tried my best to be happy and yet nothing works, my family gave up on me, my friends wouldn’t care if I went missing. And any guy I try to be with always ends up using me or admits they never really loved me... what’s wrong with me...  Maybe dyings the only thing that’ll help my pain.


I usually try to hide my problems by surrounding myself with people Ik at my school but that doesn’t always work. When I’m home I’m always reminded about how much of a disappointment I am to my family, and how little people at my school really care about me, the only people who text me are thirsty boys and that’s about it.

I keep coming to the conclusion that I’m just unlovable... and apparently I’m not the only one who thinks so, everyone kept telling me my ex said he didn’t know how anyone could ever love me... before reminding himself that no one actually does... it’s funny cuz I wasn’t the one who broke us up. He was. And I didn’t do anything to him so idk why he’d say that.

I guess I am  just unlovable."
I can't have one good day.,I hooked up with one of my cousins friends and he told me not to tell anyone. He didnt want my cousin to know. Then the next time I see him he has another girl with him. I didnt say anything but I felt like shit. Then next party I told my cousin I didnt really want to go and he got it out of me and was really sweet and supportive about it. Then I guess yesterday at gasparilla he said something to him and then he texts me this morning telling me to keep my mouth shut again because he felt uncomfortable. We are grown adults. I have no other friends. I'm all alone in this world and I'm so depressed. Please someone help me
Microdosing,I want to try microdosing with shrooms/lsd but I have absolutely no idea where or how to access it and It freakin sucks. I have absolutely no solutions anymore and it’s frustrating.
Deep depression waves,"I have recently been experiencing some extremely deep depression. I feel like I’m at a point in my life where I’ve hit rock bottom mentally and I don’t know how to even begin to dig myself back out. Therapy and medication aside (I do not have health insurance at the moment), are there any remedies that people have tried to help soothe themselves?"
Have you lost your “feelings”?,"I have been depressed for quite some time now (with days where I do feel okay — not sure how normal that is?)... and lately, I have been having more happy days than I have before (around once a week). 

I was FaceTiming my mom the other week and I noticed the feeling of love I felt toward her, and I couldn’t remember the last time I felt that way. Yesterday, I was hanging out with my two good friends... and I felt that feeling of love towards them too. I feel like I had lost the feeling of caring about people, and I hadn’t even noticed because I hadn’t felt it.  Is this normal or am I just some serial killer type?"
I feel like I'm stuck in a shitty job and every day I contemplate just crashing my car or hoping I don't wake up the next morning so it'll end.,"I'm 29 years old. Still living at home. I don't make enough money to afford to move out. I've been applying for work since august of last year. I wound up in this job after being laid off as a result of my old company being bought. Every day I go to work to do soul sucking accounting excel bullshit. Every day I drive in constant traffic to an office infested with cock roaches to stare at excel spreadsheets doing thankless work with out of date systems. All around me I see people being able to afford houses, move into their apartments, work for good companies and I'm stuck at home. I feel like a failure to my parents, and my girlfriend. I feel like I'll never be good enough. It used to be that you couldnt get a job without experience. Well the last recruiter that I spoke to told me that even though I have experience they want someone with the degree. 

150 jobs since august. Multiple resume rewrites and constant rejections via email. No interviews. When I ask people for help I get nothing. Blank stares or ""idk why this advice isn't helping you. It's what everyone else does"". So far I've had 4 mental breakdowns in the parking lot from the stress. I faked being sick last thursday and Friday just so I didnt have to go in. At this point i almost want to get fired. Why even bother to keep going anymore. Why not just go to sleep and never wake up again? It's obvious I'm not good enough to get any interviews so if it did happen it would be a favor to the world at this point. One less useless piece of shit taking up space and resources."
being depressed but having no reason to be depressed,"my life is good. i have a boyfriend, not many friends but i have good friends, and just people who care about me. but i’m still so incredibly depressed. it’s an on and off thing. one day i’m like, okay, i can get through this and i’m getting better! and the next day i can’t drive my car without thinking of running it off the road. and i have those people i care about, but i can’t mention this to them because i don’t want to worry them. i am open about my depression, but it only ever goes so deep as “yeah i’m depressed and i’m not feeling good” instead of “i don’t know how much longer i can take this or when my breaking point will be”. i feel like no one realizes how deep it is, and i know i need help but i am too afraid to admit it to anyone even my therapist (who i can’t even see anymore cause i’m poor). i’m 21 years old too and still living with my parents (which contributes to my depression further bc i have to deal with my selfish mom) but i’m just stuck here. i don’t know what to do anymore. i only keep going so i don’t put burden on my dad, boyfriend, and little brother. but for my own selfish reasons i want the pain to end."
...,"I'm not good at titles, mostly because I don't feel like I have anything worthwhile to say...I know I'm going to kill myself soon, I just don't know when and I figured...I could never leave a note explaining why the way I would like to...So I'll just leave this here and whenever I follow through, it'll give some insight...not much but some.

I got diagnosed with ADHD last year in September.....I was so bitter...I still am. I lost jobs, got kicked out of college, kicked out of my house as a teen, ended up in foster care, all kinds of nonsense; thinking if I just tried harder I'd get it right...only to find out it was beyond my control this entire time....figures.

But then in September, I took Ritalin, it was like I lived my entire life as a hoarder and suddenly realized my house was full of junk. I stared to clean up; I started going to work on time, finishing my schoolwork on time...I got a 4.0 last semester! Its not that I was dumb, I always did my work; I just always forgot to turn it in....I felt like...finally...life is going right, I can do this at last... So, I decided to try for my dream and go to law school. I studied every day 4 hours a day, did my homework and went to work...I was finally going to have the life I wanted and to get here, all I needed was the right diagnoses to help me get it together. I spent years trying to get the answer and nothing worked...now I have it and I know things will be finally be okay. I am going great in school, I am knocking my LSAT prep out of the park....I went to Yale to figure out where to set the bar....they told m it was set just fine; I had a shot as good as anyone else. I was so happy...I got this! My debt is almost gone, I can afford my life, in March  2020, I'll have worked a job longer than a year for once in my life...This is good, I got this, finally.

I got fired January 3rd. My supervisor engaged in discrimination and I fought back. I lost. I got fired and given unemployment because they reasonably would rather keep him than me. I have proof, I got a lawyer, he agreed with me and wanted to sue. I was to meet him Monday morning to get things going. I woke up Monday and thought....what was the point? Why bother, I'll look like a sore loser, strong arming my way back into the workplace was not what I wanted to do...so I just laid on my couch and I haven't gotten up since.  I stopped taking my Ritalin. I stopped studying, I stopped doing my schoolwork....I got unemployment...I guess that should excite me but it doesn't. I am a failure....Once again; putting the burden of work on my husband, even though I am in a better position to earn a higher salary and he never picks up the slack regardless.... I am back where I started just a year go...on my couch...doing nothing....but I just cannot bring myself to feel anything. This time around. I don't want to try to get another job and work for another 8 months only to get fired again....This is how it always goes, get a job, lose it in 8 months, be on the brink of poverty once more....I'm tired of this....I did everything right this time and I still got fired, so why bother.

I'm exhausted from just....trying...all the time I am trying and I clearly cannot get my shit together....this was not supposed to happen. For once I did everything right....so how am I here...on my couch...just empty and disappointed in myself. How did I get here and why do I keep coming back?

I  committed myself to personal growth these last 3 years, classes on interpersonal relationships, organizational behavior,  conflict management...all to be better...but somehow, my outcomes are worse. The more I try to provide a better life for myself, the more I fail...and I'm tired of failing. I'm tired of losing jobs, academic opportunities, relationships and little bits of myself and my...happiness....I am tired of being unhappy and never experiencing stability....I  never felt like I was asking for much, but now, waking up each day is a curse and I hate it. Life is not rewarding and I am tired of looking for the silver-lining an coming up with nickels...So fuck it....its only a matter of time before I do this all over again; even if I make it into law school, I'll screw that up some how and not understand how I did it...that is my last dream for myself...I can't bear to watch it go up in smoke."
depression dreams,"Its about the third time I've had the same kind of nightmare dream. It starts out that I'm having some sort of stress related breakdown either at home or at work and I decide to run away. Not to any destination but to go find a spot to end it. I end up getting really bad suicidal thoughts and make my way to these wildlife parks. The same lake appears and there's nothing except the mountains and forest. The water is like glass so you can see the reflection of the mountains and trees. Sometimes there's animals sometimes not, but there's always the end of a sunset, light making everything all orange. and suddenly I'm not feeling bad anymore, I just sit and feel peaceful. I'd enjoy it more if most of the dream were like that. :/

If that isn't one to take the psychiatrist, I don't know what is. 😂 I haven't even really had those thoughts for a while anyway and I'm surprised it keeps reoccuring in my dreams. Maybe I just need more sun."
A morbid thought from a semi suicidal mind,"Why isn't there a website where suicidal people can volunteer to be victims of serial killers? Or sign up to participate in scientific tests that would result in death? Like, we already want to die, why not give our lives for a reason?"
"The only thing stopping me from killing myself is how broken my parents would be. The idea of suicide has come and gone throughout the last 8 or so years but right now it’s really, really bad.","I hate that I’m 26 and live at my parents house.
I hate that I don’t have a useful secondary education.
I hate that I work a job that a 16 year old could do.
I hate that I can’t improve at any hobby of mine nor find the motivation to even do them.
I hate that I have absolutely nothing to offer.
I hate that my car broke down today and I have absolutely no money to buy a new one.
I hate that I’m still so fucking in love with my boyfriend of one month from the summer. 
I hate that his new girl is absolutely beautiful and perfect for him. 
I hate that I can’t find the push inside me to make any changes in my life or be a better person. 

I feel like a pathetic piece of shit. A nobody. I want it to be all over. My parents love me so much but I’m so so so close to the point of not even caring about how they’d do if I left. It hurts so fucking much day in and day out. I mean if I died, I’d be elsewhere and wouldn’t need to see it."
Do I Have Depression,"I've been debating to make this psot for days now because I didn't want to come off rude or insensitive to be people who actually do. All I ever feel is tiredness and feeling fed up all the time and sometime just anger at the world mainly school related stuff. I know this sounds sad but the last I remember feelibg really good was when I finished rdr2 last June. These feelings have gotten worse since October.
I say I wanna die a lot but never actually do anything because I'm too scared.

Sorry for this being messy, I didnt want to be rude I am just a confused 15 year old"
"At the end of the road, and parents are not willing to help after they paid for my meds last time.","[M22] Lost my job at the beginning of the year, I’m on unfortunately a decent bit of meds. It cost $45 for most and my parents were pissed. 

I wake up, eat somthing take my meds, play some games, fill out a few applications, take a nap, take second dose of of some of the medications.  However as of the 29th my anti depressant  is out and my parents don’t care persay they said I’ll live without it.  Last time I was without it I wanted to die.   I don’t want to die right now, but I am so anxious about running out.   

My medication is $33.89 ( GoodRX ) and I have .80 in my bank account and I just don’t know what to do."
I'm convinced I'll die because of lung cancer,"I was smoking 15 cigarettes and 5+ spliffs per day for nearly a decade. On top of that I didn't eat fruits, vegetables and other healthy food. My diet was literally just some brown bread, pizza, hamburgers, fried chicken, sushi, wok meals, candy and soda. I was underweight too. 

It took me until I was 27 (!!!) to figure out that I should eat only natural foods like nuts, fish, fibre, veggies, fruits and so on. I'm doing that right now and gaining weight. I want to have a long life, but let's be real. By only eating garbage and inhaling a shit ton of toxic smoke, I'm already completely screwed. You are what you eat they say, well, I didn't eat anything nutritious and smoked like a chimney. There's no way I'll survive this.

This depresses me so fucking much. I know I'll start coughing up blood sooner than later. Then I'll die a miserable death within one year of my stage 4 lung cancer diagnosis. There's not much I can do to stop it. The DNA damage has already been made. It took me too long to figure out how life will be better when you're focused on your longevity. My childhood was traumatic with both my parents dying so I was just focused on dealing with that and being happy in the moment. That attitude will cost me my life. Awesome. I was an idiot :("
Needing someone?,I’ve dated a girl a while ago and she just left me for another girl. I really love her. My depression makes everything worse and love just seems like another way to make everything in my life sadder. I tend to find comfort in things that aren’t there forever and I fear that someday I just won’t be able to hold everything inside of me and find comfort with such things. I don’t take medicine cause I’m very paranoid and can’t trust it. I feel very bad and it’s like she was the only thing that made me a little happier. It’s been six months since she left me and I still cry every night cause I can’t deal with losing her. I wish it would go away and I could forget her.
Sunday blues,"I finally hit the point in where nothing interests me anymore, I stopped playing video games as they make me even more bored. I made the dumb decision of blocking everyone on discord and deleting all apps off my phone, isolating myself helps everyone. No one wants to deal with some mentally illy friend, and I completely understand. I can't even bare with myself anymore, and I wish they can move on and find someone a lot better. They reported my self harm scars to my school's social worker and I don't even know who to trust anymore. Hopefully they get the hint."
Since I lost her my every day feels like a nightmare I can't wake up from.,"My whole life was pretty shitty. Stuff like being bullied, isolated, lonely, shamed of being poor, has left a rather deep, invisible at the first glance, scar. Ever since childhood I've been a weirdo. Kids just couldnt understand that I wore worn down clothes because I couldn't afford new ones. Hell, me and my 2 brothers often had to split a sweet bun(is it how you call these little, round breads with sweet filling in it? My english is still rather bad) in 3 because we couldn't afford more than one. 

The fact that my father was na alcoholic that spent 70% of the money on himself or alcohol didn't help out either. I still remember having our fridge empty for 90% of the time. He was also the cause of my first suicidal thoughts when I was 8. I wanted to kill myself and leave behind a letter, hoping that it will wake him up and he will stop drinking. Growing up wasn't much better either (although our financial situation got better and now we're a middle class). I had trouble talking to people and I kept distancing myself from others. My family also started fightig a lot and my parents were about to divorce. This was also the time when I tried to kill myself and failed. Things changed when I met my first girlfriend. 

I started opening up as a person, maturing a lot during the process. I got a bunch of friends and a loving girl. I didn't want to die anymore. I also managed to enter a very good highschool. It seemed as if my life started heading into the right direction. That was until she cheated on me a month after entering the new school. I was broken, but I forgave her. And that was a mistake. Few weeks later she cheated on me once again and left me for another guy. I also started losing my friends since we all went to different schools. The depression struck me again, causing me to lose 17kg in a few months. I tried to keep myself away from my own mind, going out with friends, getting into weird groups, alcohol and drugs. I pretty much went from a non-drinker into someone who drank large amounts of alcohol 4 times a week, being hangover at school all the time. It was also a time when my best friend broke contact with me because her BF was jealous. Just when I was about to take my second suicide attempt, I met a girl online. 

We quickly became friends and helped each other a lot. Thanks to her I quit drinking and smoking and took way less drugs. She pretty much became my soulmate. I've never been so close with anyone before. Our friendship continued for 3 years when we both confessed our feelings to each other and decided to meet for the first time (we live on the opposite sides of the country, 10h ride on a train). I went to her on the weekend (I couldn't possibly stay at her house as I was a total stranger for her family) and we rented a room in secret for 3 days. We spent amazing time together and gave each other our first times. I couldn't be any happier! We cried our eyes out while waiting for my train. I wanted to spend more time with her so I went with the last train. At around 11pm I arrived at the city I was supposed to have a bus from to my home only to find it was cancelled and the next one would be in 14h. I had a very important exam at 9am the next day, so I tried to catch a ride. No money, phone dead, unknown city and freezing weather. It started raining and the temperature was close to 0 degree celcius. I only had pants and a t-shirt on me, so after waiting a few hours outside all I could feel was cold and a huge pain from my limbs. But I wasn't upset or sad. I was thrilled! It was almost like a romantic novel. I finally managed to catch a ride at 5am. I somehow came these 200km from the city I was stuck in all the way to my school before my exam begun. When I got there I was still wet and almost fell asleep whenever I closed my eyes, but I still passed the exam. I had a flu for the next week, but it was well worth it. I started saving money to be able to meet her again asap. I lived in a rented room, so I was pretty short on cash. I cut down on my food and ate around 700-800kcal everyday, dropping around one kilo per week, but I couldn't complain. Thanks to that I was able to meet her every month. I even met her family and they liked me from the very beginning, treating me like I was their own son. I finally felt like I had a family. It was an awesome time. I loved her from the deepest part of my heart and she loved me! Whatever I considered love before, had lost all it's meaning when compared to what I felt for her. Life was the best. 

Time flew by, I graduated highschool and we were together for more than a year. I wanted to go to the college in her city. It was also when she started changing. We talked less and less and she had very little time for me. Before I knew it, she said she feels suffocated in our relationship and we should break up. I fell apart, but I didn't show it. I knew for some time now that she didn't feel it anymore and I didn't want to make it hard for her. A week later I found out that she started dating her friend who I ""didn't have to worry about"". It ruined me even more. I wasn't dumped only because she stopped loving me. I was dumped because I was worse than him. She broke up with him a few months later though. Still, getting abandoned by the only person who accepted me whole made me unable to lead a social life after that.

I went to college near my home town and rented a flat with some friends. It's almost a year since we broke up. I don't have any friends at college. Every conversation with someone causes me to feel tired, I start feeling like I haven't slept for a few days. I cry every single night, unable to stop thinking about her. I almost always have dreams in which she leaves me. I'm unable to live like a normal person. I have never felt as bad as I do now. I tied all loose ends by now and made most of the preparations for my final suicide attempt. I don't know how much longer I can endure. It all just seems pointless... I tried very hard, but I love her with all I've got and I can't live without her. I hit or hurt myself in various ways whenever I start feeling like I'm on the edge, but it stopped helping. I'm a mess. I want to live. I want to be happy and have a happy family. I want to make breakfast for my wife im the morning and take my kids to school. But I can't. I'm simply unable to achieve any of these things. I'm afraid I gave her all I had and I don't know how much longer I can endure...

If anyone read this, finding my history and emotions valuable enough to spend time on - thank you."
Derealisation - Disappointing my Parents,"Yeah so like J already said, Im Disappointing my parents pretty hard. I got dr/Dp for 4 Months now and I Started to Skip class because I couldnt sit in rooms for 6 to 9 hours a day with permanent derealisation. So In the last 2 Months I didnt go to school for one day. My Parents are talking a lot with me and am feeling worse Everyday. I got an appointment by a Doctor tommorrow because I told my parents I would like to Talk someone, but they think I only have Sleep Problems and that I am just too lazy to go to school. My Mother told me that if I dont Start to go to school again, she will Call the Cops so that they bring me there. My father said that if my Mother kicks me out of the House, he cant take me because he has the same opinion as my Mother and that his Wife wouldnt allow it anyways. So here I am, Skipped 2 Months of School, suffering from Dr/DP, Parents completly disappointet and tell me that if I dont turn my life around, they dont want to be  a Part of my life anymore. Would be nice if someone that  was in a similiar Situation would write what he did, or what would you do if you were in my situation? Im really trying to turn my life around but when its 7:00 AM and I have to go to school, My derealisation gets really strong and I have really Bad anxienty, and then I just stay at home and feel like shit for the rest of the day. 

Thanks for reading this, hope u have a great day:)

I feel incredible guilt whenever a beloved person passes away,"The recent passing of Kobe Bryant is so tragic beyond measure. This is a man who had an undeniable passion for life, worked exceedingly hard towards his goals, and was taken away at a time when he could finally really enjoy the fruits of his labor and be there with his beautiful family.

Anytime such a person dies in unexpected circumstances, one of my first thoughts is always, ""Man, I wish I could give my life so that he/she could still be here."" It seems so unfair that those who have such an obvious and infectious lust for living can die like this while I stay here on earth doing the absolute bare minimum and hating it every step of the way."
Brain is bursting with infinite thoughts,"So I am trying to just let it out somehow,
Feeling so much helpless and bad. I feel trapped from all the directions in life. The girl I like, is not with me even though I tried so much, caught up in friend zone. Level of friend zoning was so high that I was sort of wingman between her and her boyfriend. I don't want to be with her because she didn't didn't saw me as her lover, I tried to convey this every way possible but... I don't want her, but I am still in love with her

My score for getting into college is fucked, I wasted my parents money for tuitions. As here it is damn hard to get into a good college. I am fucked.

No motivation to do anything, laying on my bed at 3 am typing this shit.

BTW a friend of mine found some embarrassing silly posts I made years ago, which will be sent to everyone tomorrow and will become my joke.

Can't restore my past, can't do anything in present, future seems dark. 

I hope someone reads this and understand my thoughts, coz I am alone in the dark."
My heart is heavy,"I’m so down, I feel immobilized, everything is heavy. I am so fucking sad. I can’t even talk to the one person I want to talk to. I got reddit to feel less alone, but honestly I have no idea how this works so :/ sorry if I’m doing this wrong"
I’m so tired i can’t even talk about it anymore,
My teacher hates me,He makes me hate my once favourite subject and makes me feel like shit all the time. He always picks on me and tries to embarrass me in front of my friends. He’s a new teacher but before him the last teacher was my favourite because he always encouraged me to do my best. Now I don’t even want to try because I know I will not be good enough anymore. He purposely yells at kids when they come ask him a simple question and berates us. He even took me into his office and told me I had to get my friends to show him more respect as he deserves it. He calls us academic idiots because we are smart but apparently have no common sense. He always says that he hates this subject and hates the club. But then he rides on the back of our achievements and talks about how excited he is to go to the award ceremony’s with us. He kicks us out the classroom frequently and tells us to be quiet but then yells and interrupts our conversations. Idk what else to do but drop the subject. Nobody even listens to me because I’m a student and he’s the big amazing new teacher
I don’t feel like I’m enough anymore,"I don’t feel like I’m enough of a person anymore, like I don’t fulfill anything.

I don’t feel like I belong in college because I don’t work hard enough, but if I dropped out I’d be a disappointment. And after that, where would I go? Back to retail for the rest of my life? 

I don’t feel like I’m enough in my relationship either. I feel unlovable and unskilled and just generally a waste of time, especially knowing there’s so many other people out there for my partner and that they could very easily find someone better.

I don’t even think I count as a member of society at this point, and I don’t think I ever will."
My life has been so boring I don't even remember most of it. I've done nothing.,"All I've done is go to school and exist. I'm tired... and the best I can do with my life is date someone who's poly, has someone else she's seeing (not per-say dating, but whatever.) I don't even care about the poly thing, other than the fact I probably wouldn't ever meet someone else anyway. No one goes out of their way to flirt with me or tell me I'm worth anything.

This entire weekend I received notifications of messages from exactly two people. My girlfriend and my mom. I could drop off the face of the Earth and it just wouldn't fucking matter. 

Meanwhile I meet all these people who seem to have had better lives. Married, but poly and has another partner. Slept with a ton of people, fucking anything. I don't want to be alive anymore, was I ever even alive? Cause I barely remember anything except the shitty moments, and it feels like it was just shitty moments connected by nothing existence."
Thinking about doing self destructive things to add some spice into my life,I want to take a shit ton of hard drugs and die. I want to be used by men and have them objectify me and treat me like a fuck toy. I hate myself so much.
Numb,"My numbness started 4 days ago and I can't seem to process any feelings whatsoever except sadness, I cry often. I even lost the feeling of tiredness and even the feeling that I am sleeping I just know that I slept because I would have dreams but other than that I'm not sure if I even slept. I don't know what to do. I went to the gym didnt feel tired, lifted weights past my limit nothing hurt. Ran didnt feel tired. Has anyone else ever experienced this? It's like it blocked all the things I used to feel before for some reason. I just want to feel ""normal"" again."
I joined the military to die,"You know how some people commit ""suicide-by-cop"" where they all but force the police officer's trigger. I had the idea to do that but for the military. Would've been easy.

Go join, get sent to Iraq/Afghanistan, get blown up by an IED, done.

I was all set to go until I got assigned to a non deployable unit.

What a joke. 

Now it's much harder and I have to pretend to care."
Daily movement and tasks,"Some days I just force myself to get up and going and that snowballs into getting things done during the day. 
Other days like today, I'll do one thing like brush my teeth, then ill just crawl back in to bed. Tell myself ill try again in a couple. Depression is never ending."
They say my dogs will miss me,"I’ve always had depression, always. 

However, I don’t even feel it anymore, I just feel numb. I can’t cry, I don’t flinch anymore at thought of suicide like I once did, I don’t even feel that bad leaving my family to deal with the mess. 

I just feel numb. 

The internet says my dogs will miss me though, it’s possibly the only thing keeping me here. I workout, I talk to people about my depression, I journal, I go to work, I keep up with life, but fuck - I don’t know how to go on."
Really to give up,"Full on anxiety attack going on 4 hours now. Left my gaming group. My whole body radiates pain. Can’t stop crying.  Everyone says it gets better. Never really does though does it. It always returns. 

Friends say call me. But they don’t mean it. The reality is that having a friend with depression gets old fast."
How can I force myself to cry?,It’s fucking impossible.
Does anyone else feel like “too responsible” to kill themselves?,"I brought a human into this world and I am a wife and I am a daughter and as much as I want to give up and as much as I fantasize about ending it every hour of every day I don’t think I could actually follow through. For one I don’t think it would work the ideas I come up with, and 2- If it DID work I know I would be a coward to my child."
"Dear mom and dad,","I know you are worried about my future, as I am about to graduate and that you mean well. I know that you care about me, but that's only for now. You say that you dont know why I worry so much about money, and you say that you've saved enough to support me and my dreams. I appreciate this so much, but I know you dont mean this. I know that you will disown me in a heartbeat once you know that I'm not straight. This is why I'm so worried about the future. I've struggled with depression for many years and always thought I'd kill myself by 20, but here I am 21 years old. I still think my life will end by my own hands. But as of now, I have no idea for my future. You called me tonight about this telling me that you guys will always be there for me. I spent that whole phone call crying because i know that's not true. I've been okay for almost a week, which is crazy long, but now I'm falling back into the darkness. I keep thinking about how much of a failure I am for not being able to pursue my dream, of giving up on my dream, and disappointing you. I am so sorry."
Most posts on this sub are probably the worst thing you could read if you’re depressed.,"I used to subscribe to it, but it kept reminding me how shitty I was feeling and made me feel worse. I came on here to read strategies to help me get stuff done and stay motivated, and almost all I read is disheartening stories. In no way am I judging. Depression sucks. 

I think it’s great that there is a place for people to vent and talk like this; I think that’s necessary, but this place definitely makes me feel like I’m falling into a pit with no bottom the more I read."
I want to stay depressed (?),"Or atleast it feels that way. Sometimes it's also kinda comforting. Idk , feels weird.

On the days that i'm 'happy' i still feel like i'm missing out on something.

LIke the depression is the only thing i got. This ""me time"" ; ranting about myself, with myself... idk"
my quiet rage,"hey its been awhile, i wanna talk about a day i once had at work, you see im a quiet person if im not busy i usually sit and think (which is something i shouldnt do cause thinking leads to despair for me) 

anyway one day i was finished dealing with a customer then i sat down to wait for the next one (im a gas pump attendant) i was watching ppl walking by as i was seated anyway i was slowly getting angry, a deep fury a combination of anger and sadness with a dash of misanthropy. you see i lost a girl i loved to her reasoning that she didnt want me cause i didnt respect her decision for her to love another so she blocked me on fb.....i melted down and deleted my fb , havent looked back since this as it was a week or two ago. anyway because of reasons i always look to see if she would pass by my work place perhaps walking by but she never does and i iknow this .....i know i shouldnt care anymore but i do anyway if im not actively busy or distracted im just a quiet thing seething with rage and sadness . on the same day i think a customer noticed this about me and ask if i was ok ....i just said nah im fine and told her thank you have a nice day . dont think itd be appropiate to tell a stranger about my problems especially a customer . anyway that day after work i just took a walk around my town before i went home ....it didnt help but i feel if i didnt id go home and do something horrible to myself.

i still feel this way from time to time , rage and sadness back and forth 

hatred and misanthropy sometimes it subsides into numbness then it comes back around when im not busy for too long"

Going back to a psychiatry (For the second time),"So i have gone to the psychiatry before but i quit because there was a death in our family and i wanted to support my parents trough this.

I am now on a waiting list to go back but since the first time i have had problems with addiction (weed, alcohol and benzodiazepines) and i might consider going to a rehab center after my psychiatry.

I was wondering if some people on here have had the same issues and could share some personal story's.

I'm fully committed to it but the rehab will be super hard for me.

I would like to thank everyone in advance for helping me!"
I always feel like a loser,"I’ve been a stay-at-home mom for nearly five years. I’m 29 years old and don’t get any career. Now my children are going to go to school and I will have to go to work. But with my zero experience cv I would not get any jobs. Maybe just some part-time jobs with low salaries and it won’t be enough to raise two children. I used to make a lot of money before I have kids. I used to be confident about myself but now I feel useless and fat and ugly. It’s holiday here and meeting up together. Today my husband’s colleagues call him to go out, he used to get me to go with him to meeting like that before but now he just wants to go by himself. I feel like I may embarrass him so he doesn’t want me be there. It’s the time ppl getting around with family and be happy and welcome new year but I feel very lonely. I cry  when everyone else are sleeping. I want to be happy but I cannot."
I'm going to kill myself,"I have nothing to love for. School just restarted and already sucks. Fuck college. Just because I dont want to drag around my sister and cousin selling GS cookies, I'm a disrespectful bitch and am throwing a hussy fit. And of course, because this happened at my cousins party, I'm even more of a disrespectful, distemper bitch. My YT channel is barely growing even though I put in so much work, and of course nothing happens. I give up. Bet no one will even read this. Fuck life."
Ghosting people...helppp I’m panicking,"I need advice on how to deal with a situation. I‘m horrible with being honest to people :(

I had a date 2 weeks ago with a guy I once had a crush on back in 2013... I didn’t want to go but I met him & his friend (my old school mate) randomly in the store and he asked me. it was so awkward and my anxiety was about to explode so I just said yes.

The date went horrible for me since I was shy and uninterested(as rude as it sounds) but he liked it I guess.

Now the problem is, I just started ghosting the guy. I have no idea why I’m so stupid but I just hoped he will forget about me and I can go back to my  isolated, depressed life. But yesterday & today the friend of him started texting and even calling me asking where I am, why I ignore him. Im panicking so hard right now and i realise i have to give both of them a reply sooner or later. But I don’t know what, I’m horrible...

Please help me :(("
Tell me one good reason I shouldn’t kill myself right now ?,I’m not asking this to gain attention. I’m not asking this to hear answers like “because there’s someone who loves you blah blah blah”. I’m asking this because i honestly am so tired i just want to leave this world. I want to leave this life. I’m so over everything. I hate my life. I love my mom and my brother and I will really miss them and their probably the only thing stopping me. I know how badly it would affect them. But i just want out. I REALLLy want out.
Lost all hope,"Life is empty and I feel like I'm going nowhere, I'm worried cause I have to study some shits but I'm to depressed to focus so I'm going to fuck things even more. I have been a long time without doing anything which is not school related and that's been slowly killing my feelings. The only time I leave the house is for going to school cause I have no friends to go out or just no reason to go out. I wish I had friends to do stuff with, I don't know why I don't have any. 
Idk, I used to be bullied (not too much like in the movies) but now nobody is bullying  me directly but everyone is like super rude to me, everyone ignores me I feel invisible, ostracized. Everybody else is enjoying life and I'm wasting my youth. 
I literally spent days without talking to nobody cause I have also arguments with my parents. I think I'm a nice person and I don't know why is this happening to me. I force myself to be perfect cause I'm afraid to be rejected but I never get anything back. My parents are always throwing shit at me despite I try my best and Idk, I have good grades I don't drink or any of that stuff and they are always complaining despite that,  and they call me antisocial piece of crap and lazy. I have no social skills and I dont get invited to nowwhere so what I am supposed to do. My mother is quite asocial also so she's pretty hypocrite.  They are bringing me down instead of helping me. I hate the way I'm living my life and I don't know how to change it, I sometimes think about killing myself but I don't want to die I just wish I lived another life, I wanna escape, wanna shot myself in the fucking head and send to hell this fucking society of shit but I guess I deserve more than ending that way. I've just been waiting for years for things to get better and I've lost all hope."
Hell yeah we're sad,"(S)weet (A)nd (D)orky. But on a serious note, you guys are the most empathetic sincere loving peole ive  met my while life.  All the empathy we've learned and all the skills we are learning during this tough time will be with us forever. ♡"
Depression really does hit different at 1am,Like wtf I was in a good mood then I feel dead in side can’t lie down I feel that broken. What is it about this time of night that sucks so much dick!
Having a very hard time being alive today.,Everything feels obsolete. The hope that i developed through my recovery is all far gone now that I’m depressed again. I increased my meds and I’m hoping to make some progress. Pray for me.
What's the point?,"I legitimately don't see a point in living. The world is doomed and falling apart. All I do with my life is sit on my computer, work, eat, sleep. People in the modern world are bizarre and I don't understand them, and so I fail to relate to anyone. Every friend I do make always leaves in the end. Literally what the fuck is the point? What pay-off is this meaningless and dull existence going to have? Am I supposed to just keep trying to distract myself with a tiny dopamine boost from consumerism until I die? 

I don't understand anything anymore. I give up."
The depression feels high. The support feels low. Reality is trying to drag me down below. Contemplating whether someday this feeling will ever go.,Maybe one of these sleepless nights will subside and keep me in that little place I call wonderland~
I feel good after writing this,"Growing up I thought people could only be depressed when they were older so depression at like 7-8 felt normal to me up until I turned 15. 

Sometimes I look back on freshman year even and think “Holy shit I was really depressed then” and every time I think that, I realize I kinda still am. I’m not dysfunctional, I do things I like, and people who talk about signs of depression could never realize it’s me (ik it’s just my case but still). 

It’s this weird thing where during school I’m this “class-clown” funny guy, I get excited about things and I’m always laughing, and the minute I have time to myself I feel everything. (And I never want to hang out with people outside of school even if we’re real chill inside, so that’s a lot)

Idk what it is but I’ve been having feelings like this practically forever, but when I remember my childhood (I’m still just 17) I don’t really think about depression being a factor; it’s like it’s so engrained into me that I don’t even notice it. People don’t know and I don’t really want them to. 

Besides, I always get over it eventually - I’ve had entire years where I feel good the whole time. Maybe the weirdest thing about this is that a lot of people know me for having dry-humor and my family thinks I’m kinda emotionless (in a jokey way). But I couldn’t be any more different. I feel everything just never gave a shit to show it. 

The amazing this is that anyone I know reading this would be so fucking clueless, and wouldn’t believe it. People talk about friends of theirs who have been depressed and I can just tell they think I’ve never felt it, and I play along. I might not even post this shit cuz it won’t do shit for me.

And please, I know I should see a therapist or something, but just don’t leave a comment saying it - I won’t be mad or anything I just honestly hope no one comments at all. I don’t need a pat on the back, and I’ve accepted who I am. 

So fuck it, I’m gonna start figuring out how to get over this depression shit, I’m not gonna let it fuck with me anymore. Jesus Christ just writing this I’m starting to have some type of revelation. I don’t deserve to feel like shit all the time and bear all the weight. Time to find out what’ll really keep me happy.

I’m smiling rn lmao, I don’t know why I just got so happy."
Anyone else suffer from eye contact phobia?,"I have had it for most of my adult life.   It really hinders my chances of making friends and any socializing. 
I used to drink alcohol, and it went away if I had a few drinks.   

I quit drinking about 10 years ago, and have not really made any new friends friends since.   It’s been a constant struggle at work or anytime really. I dread running into people at the school I work in.   I sometimes choose to keep to myself so I don’t have to make small talk with people.   I’m sure everyone thinks I’m a bit strange. 

I just sometimes can’t look at people in the eyes.  I start to see it in their eyes, that I must be staring too hard or I’m making them uncomfortable.  It really sucks.   I really miss drinking for that reason only."
Accepting that your friends won’t be there for you.,"I’ve been dealing w major depressive episodes for a while and I express it to them just bc I want help and idk what to do (i make sure if its okay if i can talk to them abt this first) and its just kinda..disappointing? because when they were in a bad state i’d go above and beyond to make sure they were okay travelling hours and going to theirs as much as i can, doing activities w them etc..idk i feel like i wish i got the same even though i shouldn’t expect things from people i still wish i got the same care i gave to them ? 

it just feels rlly lonely mane and i know i should rely on myself to get better and on my own self care and growth but in these moments i wish i had a pick me up you know? 

do i sound selfish if i do please say

:/"
Really depressed right now someone please talk to me,"Feeling down, having suicidal thoughts, I need someone to talk to but my friends aren't responding."
I finally informed my psychologist about my depression and suicodal thoughts. I finally opened up.,This all happened because I just overdosed on caffeine and we had to call an ambulance. I never wanna feel like that again.
"night panic, unknown cause, cry for help","I’m not long on this subreddit and I’ve never made a reddit post so forgive me if I’m getting something wrong but I need help. I am diagnosed with BPD but it’s a messier part of my medical notes I’m having trouble with. I started going to the psychiatrist reporting visual and auditory hallucinations, delusions and paranoia. I was given no possible explanation for my symptoms but was put on an antipsychotic ‘for stress’. the antipsychotic did nothing but worsen my symptoms (according to my loved ones, not me) and I stopped taking it. Another slightly less apathetic psychiatrist told me I certainly sounded like I had symptoms of psychosis but I was far too ‘calm and gathered’ about them, whatever that means. I face my problems alone and without any idea of what they are or what causes them. It is common (at least 1-2 nights a week) that I will start to feel intense fear and dread in the night time. I will feel as though something has its eyes on me and that no matter what I mustn’t go to sleep. I shake, sweat, my heart rate is up significantly, my mouth is dry. I can never recognise these episodes while they are happening. One time I lay in the dark for 5 hours in a cold room shaking and intermittently weeping, practically paralysed with fear. I had no idea how much time had passed. I had a hallucination that I turned into an inhuman being. I felt like I’d seen something I wasn’t supposed to and my view of myself and the world felt permanently altered by the experience. I have just come out of the back of one of these and although it wasn’t as awful as the one from earlier I described I feel like I’m fighting a losing battle trying to cope with them alone. Does anyone know what I am experiencing, or where I could go? My friends are sweet and try to help but they all seem to think that the concepts I’m sharing are extremely alien. Which is why I’m here I suppose. 

If you did read, even if you can’t help, thank you for your time."
Recent experience triggered me and I don't know what to do.,"*TW, I mention sexual assault and unwanted advances.*





Almost 2 years to the day, I was sexually assaulted by a stranger. My brain has blocked out the worst of it but I'm fairly sure I was taken full advantage of. Friday night (its sunday), my step brother came onto me. Kept brushing his hand against my thigh and staring at my butt/crotch when he thought I wasn't looking. He did other things too but my brain is too jumbled to list them all.  I'm still not recovered from it and dont know what to do. I can't sleep, thinking about it makes me feel sick. It's bringing back memories of my assault and I'm losing my mind over it. My mind is all fuzzy and I dont feel like myself anymore. Every night, around the time where it happened, I get sicker and sicker. 

I dont know how to cope with this and everything it's bringing back. I'm lost."
I just want all this pain to go away,"I've fallen back into a very dark place. People say it gets easier maybe for some yeah, but there's some of us that never truly heal so we're stuck in a vicious cycle 

A bit about my childhood and why I'm so fucked in the head and why I hate life so much

So when I was around 9 years old I was molested it happened again when I was 11 it continued after that every day. Every time I fall asleep all I see is that happening all over again it feels so real it's like I'm reliving it all over again it absolutely torture. I got told that I shouldn't of provoked him pretty much telling me it was my fault I never wanted it to happen I tried pushing him away I told him no he continued to do what he was doing. I was only a child, I had no chance at pushing a fully grown man away. When I try to open up to a certain someone I get told that they don't want to know about it and that it shouldn't be effecting me now because it's in the past. I hate dealing with this on my own I'm at wits ends I don't know how much more I can take why can't I just ease my memory 😭😭"
My brain is restless,I'm slowly going insane. Nobody can see it because I can still hide it. Everything I look at is wrong. My thoughts are a mess. My brain feels like it's vibrating. I want to do things things that seem insane even to me but feel perfectly natural. I'm having a mental breakdown. I must have every mental illness under the sun. There's something laying within my mind and it's bubbling over the surface. One day I'll wake up and it won't be me looking back at me in the mirror. I'll be gone. And who know what will remain. But I can't tell anyone. I don't want to be treated like I am insane. I'm seeing things.
I want to hold on to my emotions.,"So I’ve recently gone through some heartbreak and it was enough to get me feeling again. Even if it’s pain, it’s invaluable to me right now. I don’t want to lose touch with my emotions again. I want to be able to cry if I need it, be able to express when I need to. Does anyone have any advice? It’s important to me. Thank you so much for your time."
I don’t know what to do anymore,"I am a 16 year old,  and I feel so apathetic about everything. I used to be someone who found people to be interesting. I used to truly love people. Even though I have social anxiety being around people truly did make me happy. It would make me uncomfortable because of my irrational fears, but I deeply cared about others.

I would never harm another person or anything along those lines. But, I feel like I am losing the empathetic person that I once was. I feel scared and so worried. I find myself not wanting to be around people at all, and I would rather just stay home alone, all day, everyday. 

Apathy is taking me over. My apathy isn’t allowing me to enjoy life or feel remotely satisfied or happy with anything. I don’t care about others like I used to. Sometimes I get in this really mean state of mind. I feel disgusting for it. I am becoming this really vile person.

I don’t want to talk to anyone. I don’t want to see anyone. I don’t want to do anything. The only thing keeping me afloat currently is my grades. I force myself to make good grades, because it is the only thing currently giving me satisfaction in my life. 

I am not trying to victimize myself. I know that it is my fault for feeling this way. I know that I need to become more self aware, and fix myself. I realize this, and yet I am still in the same place."
Why only some of us have to face the burden of mental sickness? It's unfair.,"Title. I have many illness and since I can recall and I've always wondered, why me? Why can other people just live their lives freely and calmly, but I have to be constantly under the pressure and suffering of my illnesses? It's unfair, and I don't understand, because I think I'm a good person, I don't think I deserve suffering this much. Sure, treatment helps, but still some symptoms never leave me.
What do you guys think?"
Why do you find life worth living?,"I have been seriously struggling with enjoying my own life, seems like I have nothing... My family is all as emotionally challenged as me; I feel like I have no friends; I spend most of my days by myself. I go grocery shopping, I go to my college classes. I just don't know why I am doing any of it or how to change."
Laziness vs Depression?,"Hello, I made this throwaway account because I really wanted to come on here and get some insight and advice on my current situation. I’m currently a high school senior and I have not been doing so well for the past few years. During my sophomore year, I started noticing that my mental health was declining gradually. To give you a bit of a background, I live in a house with very strict, narcissistic parents. I think of my house like a prison because the only places I’m allowed to go are school, church, and anywhere else I must be with one of my parents or older siblings. For the sake of time, I’m not going to go into too much detail, but I’ve had to grow up around a lot of physical and verbal abuse in my house, primarily done by my father (also mention that my parents are Caribbean). Growing up, I’ve basically been neglected in terms of not having emotionally available parents, I only had parents who fed me, gave me shelter, and gave me clothes. I added this info in because I feel as though this is what is causing me problems.

Basically, with my current situation, I’m in a spot where I can’t tell if I’m showing symptoms of a mental illness or if I’m just being lazy and trying to make myself believe that there’s something wrong with me to justify my behavior. I’ve had moments where I would think to myself “what if nothing is wrong with me and everything that I believe is mentally wrong with me is just not true?” I haven’t been handing in assignments on time anymore and it makes me feel so guilty. I constantly cry because I get these recurring anxious thoughts, and one of the most common ones is that the teachers who I have now will talk to the teachers I had previously and talk about my low work ethic. It may sound ridiculous to some, but I can’t stop these thoughts from constantly reappearing. I try hard to stay motivated to do my work, but either I blank out and stare at my computer screen/wall or I go to sleep for long periods of time and wake up exhausted to the point where I don’t even want to bother doing the assignment that day. I always have the problem where I come home from  school and I’ll cry to the point of exhaustion or just feel so numb and end up waking up around 9-10 PM and staying up till 3-4 AM trying to do homework or study. I can’t talk to a therapist as of right now because my parents will never let me see one (and that includes my school psychologist - I would need parental consent first). I’ve been holding onto the thought that I’ll be able to leave for college soon and that I’ll be able to seek help then, but I don’t know what to do right now. I don’t understand why I keep feeling the way I do because I used to be the student who always handed in her work on time, if not early. At first I thought it was just a case of “senioritis” but there are times where I feel as though that isn’t the case. I want to know your guys’ take on this, my mind is going crazy thinking about whether I’m just being lazy or not."
How do I bring up my sexism to my female therapist?,"For reference, I’m a second year college student. 

My father died when I was very young. I grew up with my mother and a few older sisters. 

For the longest time I internally blamed my mother for my fathers death even though it was purely of natural causes. I have gotten past this but I think it’s left lasting effects. My sisters and my mother would frequently lash out at me and I think from a young age that enforced a sort of misogyny within me. I was also told to “be a man” a lot in situations that caused me panic. 

Flash forward to high school and my first girlfriend cheated on me. She also would frequently act like I needed to man up about things. 

I think the combination of what happened with her and with my family had created a deep-seated resentment toward women. For a while I just kinda went with this subconsciously. I still had/have plenty of friends that are girls; however, I had this hatred about me. For example, and you’re going to hate me for this, but when some girls at my high school accused one of my favorite teachers of sending inappropriate  messages, I absolutely refused to accept it until later when there was undeniable evidence. I also have a very hard time coping if I’m outperformed by a woman in something. I feel incredibly angry toward female figures of authority in my life. I was resentful toward this women’s march in 2017 as well. I (wrongly) felt like it was a misandrist movement. 

About a year ago (freshman year of college), I started seeing this girl and we’ve been together since. I really love this girl, I’ve learned a lot from being with her. I realized how horrible I had become and began to try and change. I was doing well it until the whole Iran thing started. A few weeks ago when the draft fears were going on, I just kinda relapsed and felt an intense hatred toward society because it makes me feel so expendable.

I can’t take this anymore. I don’t want to be sexist anymore. I know that it’s wrong for me to have those thoughts but I just can’t control how I feel.

I’ve been going to therapy for about two years to deal with general life stressors and anxiety. I have been seeing a female therapist. I want to bring this up with her. I am really scared to because 1) this is not an empathizable issue and 2) I am scared of judgement. I know she wouldn’t overtly judge me, but I’m scared it will make her see me as a fundamentally shitty person, which I know I have been, but I’m trying to fix that. So how can I go about this?"
Is it possible that my anxiety is causing me to become depressed?,"I usually am very shy because of anxiety and my thoughts range from everything i do wrong shouldn't have happened bc i knew better then to mess up like that, to omg im bothering this person by messaging/talking to them. Are these thoughts causing my feeling of worthlessness and sadness?"
I'm 31 and have struggled with mental illness since preteen.,"I guess this is just a vent, I'm not looking for advice or pity, just wanted to have a place to type how I feel. 

For most of my life I've struggled a lot with extreme anxiety, depression, BPD, and issues with explosive anger. I've tried therapy but really never connected with anyone, it feels to fake to pay someone to listen to me knowing I'm just a name on a sheet and only matter for that hour I'm there. Tried a bunch of different medications but I absolutely hate not feeling like myself, being drowsy often, oversleeping, it makes my anxiety and depression worse because I hate that feeling of being unproductive. 

My whole life I've had these periods where I would shut myself off for a few months or whatever or get sucked into some pathetic relationship and devote my whole existence to that basically pushing everyone away. I still managed to keep 1 or 2 friends but the past year I had a falling out with my only friend, in fairness she was a really toxic person but I dealt with it because she dealt with my trashyness. For the year following I couldn't even force myself to leave the house, I didn't text anyone, didn't call, wouldn't even shop for myself. I slept a lot, played a lot of games and checked out of my life. 

The past 2-3 month's I've been trying so hard to get my life together, go out again but I have no one, not even casual acquaintances. I don't understand how to make friends and I usually find it really defeating anyway, never anything in common because I lack a personality, I do have an advanced degree but never really used it and the whole brain fog with depression kinda blocked all those things out so I always feel stupid chatting with someone going for the same thing like I can't convey my thoughts ever and it's just a nagging feeling they think I'm a complete moron. Even on dates I've resorted to playing dumb af because it's easy, or when they bring up hobbies/ interests/anything I have nothing. What do I say? Oh hey, I stay at home 24/7 and chill with my pets because even my job doesn't require me to interact with anyone or even leave my home. 

Maybe it's just the usual nihilistic dread setting in, but what's the point? What am I living for anymore? I can't think of anything I enjoy anymore. Keep trying to force myself to do new things hoping I find something I'll like but it's been really hard with no support, I don't want to be consumed by my mental illness and waste my life and I'm doing my best here, hopefully this passes. Thanks for reading if you did."
My parents would blame for my sister's death,"Hello, I'm Gretel, 18 year old Mexican female. I want to be brief, I tried to kill myself two months ago by jumping off the rooftop, but I only broke my arm. However I stopped thinking about suicide thanks to my psychologist. She told me about this social media site so I come to share what I feel.

All my suicidal thoughts started when at age 5, I accidentally caused an accident which killed my sister. She was my twin, 5 as well. My parents won't stop blaming me for her death. We were playing on my house stairs and I stumbled and made a decoration statue fell on her head. She had seizures and I didn't do anything to save her. When my mom came to help her she was dead. I cannot forgive myself for that even if my psychologist has already told me I'm not the one to blame.

I am following my therapist's advice on posting my story on many websites so I can see that many people would tell me it is not my fault, so please be honest.
Sorry about my English, I speak Spanish as my first language."
Travel Anxiety,"I've been suffering with anxiety related to travelling for a while. It's mostly the feeling of being trapped, as if once I'm on a plane or a bus I can't just get up and leave or I feel as if I'm forced to be there. I have a tendency to overthink by a mile and I always find myself overthinking the 'what-ifs' and the possibilities of an accident, which makes me panic. However, in a few months I'll be taking a 10 hour journey for a holiday. Is there anything that can help a little? (for example, techniques or items that can prevent panic attacks or anxious feelings or thoughts)"
"My whole life I've been told ""remember me when you're famous"" or ""help me out when you're a millionaire"" and I feel like I can't talk about it","Because it makes me sound like the most r/humblebrag guy in the world. 

But since reddit is anonymous, here I go. I'm really good at the things I do. I was taking college courses on programming when I was 15 and I run a semi-successful YouTube channel on programming tutorials. I also act, sing, and write and have been provided a good amount of opportunities to expose those things from professionals seeing and liking my work.

Now this makes it seem like I've lived an easier life, and could even give people the viewpoint of thinking I don't understand a struggling life.



But that isn't the case. 


I grew up with an abusive father who had hidden cameras installed in our house. When I became an adult I moved out and due to financial struggles became homeless. I lived with my mom who makes no money. I've always been fiscally lower class. I own 1 jacket and 1 pair of jeans and theyre all ripped up. I had a therapist once in my life and she illegally revealed what I talked about to my father, who she was good friends with (I didn't know this during the therapy of course). This elevated my paranoia

I have depression, anxiety, and insomnia issues but I can't afford my medication.


I've tried to keep this relatively light hearted but here's the thing: I've had 6ish suicide attempts and used to have a major cutting problem. I'm probably gonna try to go again before I turn 21, which is in a month. Thanks for reading"
Canadian who wishes he was born an American.,"I wanted to be a voice actor for video games. If we're being general, that is something I could do in Canada, but for AAA titles, that would be something done exclusively in LA, in the US. 

I'm still starting out with voice acting, and I'm having a lot of fun when I do it, but immigrating to the US is always at the back of my mind. It's not only where the big stuff is done, but living there would mean to be part of what many praise as the best country in the world. 

I'm aware, however, that immigrating to the US is a tall order. It's something that may never fall into the cards for me. So I guess what I'm wondering is, how do I cope with wanting something that may never happen, and accepting where I'm at in life/where I live."
dissociating for the first time in months,i don’t even know the last time i dissociated. i don’t remember what i did to ease it. i can’t stop scratching. im unplugged. any advice would be appreciated.
Therapy makes me feel sick.,"I was wondering if it is normal to feel worse after therapy. For context, I have extremely bad anxiety and moderate depression. After therapy, I feel so wiped out  and cant do anything else all day. Sometimes I have panic attacks during these sessions, but even if I dont, I still end up being very exhausted. It's so bad I haven't gone to therapy in over a month. This has happened with all the counselors and therapists I've been to. My current therapist isnt bad, so I dont think  changing therapists would do anything."
Make every part of the journey a reason to celebrate!,I had a bit of fun after my psychiatric evaluation. Every step in the process is (hopefully) one step closer to healing and getting well.  [Who wants cake?!](https://imgur.com/a/hZUL1nD)
Need advice,I’m currently on leave from work because my mental health is really bad. I suffer from depression and anxiety. Work was stressing me out and making me anxious. I’ve been on leave for 3 weeks now and I’m so bored and I feel so useless I’m going insane. I feel like because I feel useless my depression is getting worse. I want to go back to work because I’m so bored and I want something to keep me occupied but I’m scared about going back before I’m better.
Can abuse affect me years later?,"Hello, I'm 17 and was abused by an ex for about 2 years 14-16, he would cause me great pain due the relentless emotional abuse he would inflict. My father has also emotional and physically abused me on and off, but he is kind to me and I still love him very much. Yet none of this abuse really affected me that much during this time, yet for the last couple of months it just feels like I've come to the realization of how severe it was/is. I've been in a new relationship for about 4 months and I realize Im always apologising and thinking the worst about everything. On top of these two abusers in my life I underwent severe mental health issues in mental school with meds, and toxic friendships for the past 5 years. In middle school I was heavy bullied which caused me to distance myself from everyone my first two years of highschool, not talking to anyone besides my boyfriend, who was emotionally abusing me. As stated above I really never let it get it me, or so I thought. Now everyday I think of his abuse, and I'm scared of men due to my father and him, not to mention people in general. I feel more and more upset the deeper I realize what I went through, I'm not a victim, I don't want to be. But I was abused, and my question is, I didn't get hurt at first, but now it's catching up to me, is this normal?"
Just a vent about never being enough romantically idk,"Okay so I don’t know where else to put this so I thought I’d put it here as I believe it stems from depression.

 Ever since I was young I’ve always internalized this thought that nobody could ever truly be satisfied romantically with who I am as a person, that whoever I’m with is always going to be left wanting something that I can’t provide and that’s going to lead to cheating or heartbreak. And I don’t understand why I have this thought process, I’m by no means a model but I’m relatively attractive and by most all accounts I’m a good and interesting person I’m 19 and male by the way. 

But no matter how many times this is told to me and no matter how true I know it is I just simply cannot comprehend the concept of somebody choosing me, of being someone’s first choice as a partner. 

I’ve always felt like I’d be the guy that would end up with a decent looking girl after she had exhausted all other options. And not in like I’m a pleasant surprise way but in a way she has become too weary to try harder than me and that I’ll “do”.

I just feel like I’ll be able to be fully in love with someone but I’ll never get that in return. I’ve just developed such a bleak outlook about my future prospects as far as love goes. It’s become something I ruminate on daily and I don’t know why, I feel like it can’t be true but even newton died alone.  I just don’t understand why I can’t get this out of my head that I’ll never find someone who is satisfied by what I have to offer. Like I know I do have a lot to offer somebody and that I’m a kind hearted person but I just feel like that won’t ever be enough for someone.

That just being a good person isn’t enough, that I have to always be funny and approachable and always be fun and basically have to mutilate my own personality to be desirable and that prospect is just so depressing to me that in order to be attractive, I can’t be me, I have to pretend. I have to seclude myself into a corner of my mind and let my real self out only when I’m alone like a husky kept in a kennel all day. And all the rest of the time put on a paper thin mask for everyone else. 

I don’t know this is just venting honestly but it sucks having this in my head all day"
When do psychiatrist call it quits?,"Hello, 

My son(25m) has had bipolar depression for 5 yrs now and his doctors have tried all kinds of medication and treatments but nothing seems to help him for long, He has had countless times of suicidal intentions and has tried 4 times, He has also been hospitalized 15 times for it, 9 of which was in a state hospital, I love him and I want him to be happy but most importantly safe, When does the psychiatric system just say, you know what enough  is enough and just keep him in the hospital because I don't think holding him for 3 to 60 days is doing any good."
I wish i knew how to handle attention,I crave attention yet the second i receive it i panic and retreat from it. It’s an endless cycle of asking receiving and pushing away. I wish i knew how to handle normal amounts attention without freaking out
Is this a common thing?,"Hey, I’ve recently been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. I’m currently waiting for a therapist to be free, so I’ve not really had a chance to discuss my symptoms in depth with a professional yet... 

One of the struggles I’m facing is trouble sleeping. For instance, sometimes I’ll be extremely tired but as soon as I lie down my heart starts racing and I get this unsteady/anxious feeling in my body and stomach, like I’m about to go on a rollercoaster ride or something (I hate rollercoasters) I’ll think to myself ‘I have no reason to worry, I’m just going to sleep. There is nothing I have to do tomorrow, no pressure’ but it doesn’t work... I’m wondering if this is a common thing to experience, and if so if anyone has any advice?"

How much do you cry in therapy?,"Some people make it sound like they bawl their eyes out at most of their appointments. I usually get misty eyed, but have never cried harder than tears gently rolling down my cheeks. I use a lot of restraint, because I can’t allow myself to cry as much as I want to. 

My therapist has asked me about it, and I’ve told him that if I started *crying* I would never stop. It can take me hours to stop crying completely if I let it out, and that *still* is showing some restraint. If I cried naturally each time I felt like it, it’d be like sobbing and wailing as if somebody had died. But then again I have BPD and I experience emotions to extremes.

Do you let it ALL out in therapy?"
Blehh,I wish I wasn't alive and could just skip the journey to the end.
Idk what the fucks going on in my head,"I’m 16. For years now I’ve felt depressed, confused and overall not real. Been on a rollercoaster ride with fixing myself but nothing works. It would start by just going to the doctors/ school counsellors (my mum would make me). I could never speak to them about how I feel so it never worked. Recently did out of school counselling, but again I don’t talk. I discovered along the way a thing called derealisation and related to every single symptom- feeling like you’re in a dream. That’s me. That’s what I am. No one gets it though not even the counsellors. I want to be fixed and feel normal again like I did as a kid. My mind works so weirdly. I’m obsessed with conspiracy theories and thinking of alternate dimensions and what could be. That fucks with my head even more. I don’t know what to do. I just want to feel sane."
I feel incredibly depressed today for no reason,"Today at church I felt like I just wanted to go home really bad. I also didn't feel like talking at all. I just thought my social battery had died really quickly for some reason (I am an introvert) but after a while I noticed it was sadness I was feeling. Deep, oppressive, suffocating sadness. I can't think of any reason I feel this way, but it sucks. Tears are coming out if my eyes as I type this and I just don't get it. The only thing that made it go away was playing video games, but I didn't feel happy, I just didn't feel as numb. But if I thought about my mood at all I would feel the nagging sadness again. 

I have been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (and take medication for it) but this is a brand new feeling for me."
Nights like these i dread the most,"One of those nights where i stay up in bed and think and cry while laying down and i don't even know why. It all gets too much. Too overwhelming in my head. Makes me just wanna be held without being hurt. I messed up earlier again and my mind is torturing me for it and all i can do is cry. I feel like there's something ripping me apart inside me and i just can't let it out but holding it inside is oh so painful. I don't really want to trust anyone anymore because i know i shouldn't. It doesn't help that my brother flipped out on me about something earlier and as i replied to him more angrily, he grabbed my jaw and i just told him to keep his hands off me but it made me pretty upset since i'm a girl. I just sat on my bed and stared blankly at the wall and sobbed and literally felt like my mind was completely distant from my body. I don't even know how to put how i feel into words and it annoys me. It feels like there's a huge pressure on my chest and i can't breathe. I just wanna hold my pillow under my head and never let go. Let it dry my tears. I feel so hopeless. God help me.."
[Too Afraid to Ask] Is drinking typically allowed in therapy?,I will be starting soon. I have a really hard time opening up to people unless I’ve had a few drink in which case I’ll spill everything. Is this something I could do during a session? Or maybe at least in the beginning?
"Idk what this , could someone maybe help?","So I’m not fully concerned about this , it happens kind of often but only in certain situations.
Basically in situations there’s, well not a voice but more like, a thought telling me “what if you just did so n so right now” or along the lines of that.
So I’ve been like in the car with the window down and it’s like “what If you just threw your phone out the window like right now , why not do it , like go” and then I have to like grip my phone really hard and it makes me on edge. I’m not afraid of heights but similar things happen when I’m on a bridge , so the phone thing and as well it’s like “what happened if you just like jump off right now , why not” and like I get kinda stressed (I’m not depressed and the thought of killing myself has never ran over my mind so it’s not that).  As well as that a more serious one is when I’m near roads , I get this big impulse to just run across the road and some times I wait until there are no cars and like walk back and forth so it like get rid of the feeling and I like get this adrenaline rush when It like comes to it. Around roads I usually cross just like really quickly and my friends are confused to why I just randomly crossed instead of getting to the crossing and this is why. And I think the only other one I’ve experienced is recently with like large kitchen knifes i feel like “ what if I dropped it right no on my foot or like just stabbed myself “ and it’s got to times before I’ve like had to put the knife down because I get so anxious though I’d doubt I’d ever do that. Same happens with scissors.
In the moment it just feels like a really over whelming feeling of you should do this and usually goes when I get away from the thing or the area or safely do it , like run across the road when no cars are there. It’s never been dangerous except from maybe this one time when I was younger , was one of my first experiences of this , and I just felt an impulse and was waiting to cross but then I just like ran and this car was coming round the corner and it got really close like I missed it by a second. But apart from that it’s never got dangerous because I think I’ve learnt / am learning to avoid the impulse , sometimes though I do get scared I might just do it but I doubt.
I kinda just know what it is so I could like help it , you get me."
"I need help. Please advise me, because my mind is very messed up right now","This will be very lengthy, but I beg you, please read my thoughts. Theres nobody else. I would really appreciate it to have somebody to advise and listen (or read in this case) my troubles.


My mental health is in shambles. Where to start. Lets start with the academic stuff. My grades suck. They are terrible, yet I cant study. I simply idly scroll by in reddit, read novels/manga, watch YouTube. When Im on the verge of breaking down at my own patheticness, and force myself to study and do my homework. I cant. 
Every second I spend trying to makes my head hurt, and its not hurting due to overworking. Its this uncomfortable, nagging pain that numbs my brain and makes it hard to think. This numbing pain is combined with a longing to do literally anything else. Go have a snack, check my phone, go to sleep, it doesnt matter. Every fiber of my brain wants to run away because I am simply incapable of studying. You might be thinking I might just be retarded. But Im not, atleast not in the sense of being dumb. Lazy? Definetly. Foolish? Indeed. But I can comfortably make deductions and observations and think smart when I do something I enjoy, like games or trying to understand a character in my favourite book. Yet when it comes to studying, I just cant. Atleast not when doing homework. Within the class, theres still a nagging to escape and not do it, but if I ignore it I can still enjoy listening to the teacher and trying to come up with smart answers/observations. I like doing that, it makes me feel a little useful and productive you could say, since there is always either praise from someone or a feeling of accomplishment. Sitting alone in my room doing homework on a subject I hate doesnt. I hate it. It makes me nauseous. You might be thinking ""why not pick up something you like?"" There isnt. I hate the very concept of work and study. All subjects, and any activity,I hate them all. Why I dont know, I used to enjoy it. Perhaps I enjoyed the company rather than the activity, but now I dont. And as expected, my reports are usually C, Ds or even Fs. I might get a B or A if its an easy subject like Spanish, but thats about it. Im 18, in Upper Sixth, following the British curriculum, though Im not british or in Britain. 

Now, my social life. Its in shambles. I have no friends. Not online, not  in real life. Why? In real life, because I talk to nobody, and nobody talks to me. I used to have friends, but then changed schools for a year for personal reasons. Had a couple of superficial buddies there. Then returned to my old school, yet we were now distant and awkward. We hanged out at first and chatted, but grew apart. Now its not surprising if I spend my day having uttered literally 0 words outside of the classroom. We used to geek out over games, but my parents took them away when I was 17 and then ""forgot"" where they put it. I havent asked since, since I know its for the best. Yet now I dont follow their conversations. Im not interested in random celebrities who Ive never met. I dont care about some dudes kicking a ball around. No, Im not buying the 20th FIFA game that looks exactly like the 19th but slightly tweaked. No, I dont want to go smoke weed and do drugs with you. 
Due to my clashing interests, we stopped talking, and I stopped getting invited to their parties, which I used to attend to play games, hang out or drink. After having spent half a year in solitude, Ive lost my ability to socialise, in the sense that I have no tact of social queues (or perhaps never did) and talk about things nobody cares about, and I dont care about what they are into. I tried to be respectful and lend an ear, but obviously we dont share the interests. I now have trouble even producing my voice. Usually the first spoken words of the day are hard to pronounce because my voice chords feel strange when used, and I end up saying it weird until I get used to my voice. If on a holiday, I may spend the whole week without speaking even once, other than my own mutterings to myself.

At home, I'm alone nearly all day. My mom is in another country with my sister due to family problems. Before they simply fought, so atleast its quiet now. I live with my dad, but he  always either comes home in the morning/late night, or not at all. Every time he comes, he is either drunk or drugged. He does cocaine. And also often visits prostitutes. When my mom found out it was the breaking point. (She felt it weird how he is never home, and how his eyes were sometimes glaced, so she investigated, noticed the odd white powder he sometimes had, and got mad, trying to make him stop. He promised he would. He didnt. Then she installed a GPS in his car to know where he drives, and found him driving to brothels. That was the last nail on the coffin. They are now unofficially divorced. Why am I sharing this? Because theres nobody else to share it with. This is an outpour of half a years worth of locked up emotions. A tangent of tangents.) Well, back to the point. Im alone all day at home too. And even when Im not, I dont speak to my dad because Im socially inept, and the age barrier means our interests clash. Also, its hard to talk to drunk people. But dont misuderstand. He isnt a bad father. He isnt abusive, and he works to earn us money. He is just messed up, just like me. As such we arent poor. In fact you could say we are more mid-upper class, since we can afford a small home on rent in a nice neighbour quite close to the beach. Not that I ever go there.

Ive also got a music addiction. When I wake up, I wake up to the sound of the music in my earphones. If not, I put them on and get out of bed. While Im having breakfast, I listen to music. When I go to school, I listen to music. When Im in class, I listen to music if we are allowed. When Im on break or during a self study/free period, I listen to music. On my way home, I listen to music. At home, I listen to music. When I lay down to go to bed, I turn on my music and fall asleep to it. And its rarely relaxing. I usually listen to heroic, epic, instense or energetic music. Why? It helps boost my morale enough to keep going. Stuff like the Demon Slayer OST, Persona music, boss fight themes, Dark souls, or Mili tracks if I feel like being even more depressed. And I need to listen to music all the time. Otherwise, my thoughts become dark and complicated. And I start thinking about depressing things. Every second without music makes me more depressed. I need the loud music to drown out my thoughts and liquify my worries. This also plays a factor in why I dont talk to people anymore. Im always listening to music and/or on my phone. The internet also helps dumb down my excessively complicated thoughts or focus them on enjoying something else and thinking hard about something else. 

Ive got every depression symptom. When Im not listening to music, I am always very sad and depressed, and my thoughts can casually shift to suicidal ones. Im also absolutely fearless of death. In other words I couldnt care less if I die some day. I have 0 self preservation desires. Instead its the opposite, I have sacrificial urges. I assume this is because my life is so empty I want to go out by protecting someone. If I ever see somebody about to get hit by a truck, I can absolutely guarantee I would throw myself in the middle to defend them and selfishly end my life in a more meaningful way, having saved a life. Ah, getting isekaied also seems like an interesting prospect.
And obviously as you could tell from before, I am constantly anxious. Even if Im very good at having a passive mask of nonchalance in real life, not that anybody cares to check my wellbeing though.   Im also always tired, no matter whether I slept well or not. Sleeping well simply erases physical fatigue, but my mind still always feels exhausted.
I also have very bad sleeping patterns. Either I dont sleep at all, sleep very little, or sleep a lot. When theres no school, the sunlight outside my window is what notifies me that I should go to sleep. For example, today I went to sleep at 2pm. And woke up at 8pm. My eating habits are also terrible. As you would expect, there is 0 regard for a balanced meal. If Im entertained on my laptop, then spending the whole day without eating is nothing unusual. But if Im bored I might spend all day snacking on cookies or the like. I eat only to shut up the pain if I feel it or to pass time and avoid responsibilities.

Theres so much more I could tell you about my messed up self, but this would turn into a proper novel if I do that. This is the overview, more or less. I was planning on contacting a doctor and asking for antidepressants or something. Im just generally a failure of a human being, messed up in the head and thoroughly lazy. I thank you for reading through this slog of filth and disappointment. If you've got some advice, that would be very much appreciated, but I honestly just wanted to express myself a little. My emotions have been becoming damper. I dont feel rage, hatred, jealousy or other such emotions, except for the ocasional pang when seeing somebody happy. I myself also dont particularly feel ever joy or happiness. Just sadness or that empty feeling of satisfaction when Im enjoying reading or watching something. That feeling of entertainment. If I see something funny I laugh, but that is only temporary. I don't actually stop feeling depressed. Nonetheless, even when I feel sad, I have trouble expressing it. When my mom tried to kill herself. I felt very sad and guilty, yet I couldnt cry. On the other hand, I had no trouble sobbing over some poor souls fate in my manga. In other words, my emotions are also messed up. Im sick in the head.  

Thank you for listening. Please help me. My greatest social enjoyment is opening up the notifications of a website or app and reading the comments people leave behind, even if half the time they are insulting me and shitting on my opinion or point of view. I also enjoy arguing in the internet, even if its with idiots, or if I am being the idiot. Thats because Im that starved to socialize. If a classmate ocasionally acknowledges my existence I get a pang of happiness that I otherwise dont experience. Way too exagerated for how I should be feeling.

That is all. If you want to ask me something else in the comments. Feel free to do so, I absolutely dont mind answering them, even if only to pass the time or have a semblance of a convo."
Is there anyone here who can help me with some advice. I just don’t know what to do and need someone who understands depression. Thank you.,
Why do I want to go back?,"I’m going to try an keep this as short and precise as possible 
Depression plagued my life for 4 years and there was nothing I wanted more than to be happy again
But eventually I got over it and I’ve been depression free for 3 years, but I always had a strange desire to go back to being mentally ill but I mostly tried to ignore it.
5 months ago I became suicidal for about 2 months.
But now I feel incomplete and I need to be depressed and suicidal again 
The need to be whole again consumed my mind
And I have gone out of my way to ruin things in my life so I can feel that way again. 
I know it’s not healthy but I need to be depressed again, there was something so comforting about it.
I don’t know what to do and I’m afraid if I tell anyone I feel this way they’ll think I’m crazy 
I need advice"
Psych evaluation tomorrow,"I am a severe alcoholic who just began the road to recovery 3 days ago. But I am coming to realise that I have been using alcohol to subdue my severe anxiety. I've battled mental illness for most of my life, but in my early 20s I gave up meds and took up the bottle. For as long as I can remember I would have episodes of severe anxiety that would last a day or two. But the last few days have been the worst. I've maybe had 4 hours of sleep in the last three days. Never sleeping more then 15-20 minutes. I constantly have racing memories I regret or fear cycling and creating no scenarios. Ive been having about 10-20 panic attacks a day for the last 3 days. Yesterday I went to the ER because I woke up from one of the ""naps"" to a panic attack and the first thought was ""I can't take this, I could end it all"". I was a little calmer when I got there and I talked to a psych there. They set me up for a psych evaluation on Monday. I'm terrified, but I'm ready to start my recovery the right way. I just need help"
I’ve been feeling triggered and need some support.,"I was in a relationship and thought it was all perfect. But then she ghosted me for like a month then apparently dumped me. I was genuinely sorry for my mistakes and have from them on sought inner peace from the past. But I wish it didn’t have to end with such trauma. 
I’ve been having PTSD symptoms from her and this breakup for almost what seems is a year. I wish we could at least talk about it so this pain didn’t continue but it’s like she hates me and ignores me from now on. I just need to feel some support and that’s all I ask for..."
I feel like a ghost,"Throughout all my life I always felt like I was in my own bubble. I'm an introvert and I don't talk as much as those around me. I have some friends, but they don't give any effort. Right now my mother has cancer and i've been very upset about it, but i'm trying my best to cope with it. No one has really asked how i'm doing or how i'm coping with this. People are telling me that they are there for me. My friends are there for me. But I shouldn't have to reach out to these people in my lives to tell them how i'm doing, instead it should be the other way around. I feel like a ghost. I feel like i'm existing, but everyone around doesn't really acknowledge my existence. No one gives effort into emotionally supporting me, instead I'm basically just told to emotionally support myself but thats not the right thing to do or say. 

My family is telling me that I have to emotionally support myself in this hardship that i'm facing now instead of actually providing it. I don't talk to them as much because they sometimes don't really know what goes on in my mind. The only one that I can truly talk to is my therapist and shes there for me. Sometimes I feel like whenever I'm around people its as if i'm the only one there. I try my best to keep in touch with family and friends, but its not a one-way street. 

&#x200B;

I've had this problem my whole life. Sometimes I feel like i'm my own best friend and i'm the only one that can support myself although I would like others to give that effort in creating a stronger relationship. Part of it is just me, but another part of it is the socialization I have with people. Its not me, its them. I tell my family I have anxiety about what my mother is facing, but they don't really care and just say to fend for myself. I feel like i'm existing in my own world, its not bad, but it could be better."
"I'm going to kill myself, I'm in so much pain. This is too hard.","I don't matter.

Edit: here's a link to the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/etzim2/insecure_about_my_ethnicity/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) that explains it."
I don’t know what’s wrong,"I don’t know what’s going on. Certain things just put me in this feeling, I can’t explain it. At dinner today I sat at the corner of the table so I had no elbow room, no room to move or anything, people would put their arms and sleeves over and on my food and I just got this feeling, I just wanted everything to stop, I wanted to push them away and cry. I could hear everyone like they were yelling. It’s not the first time it’s happened. It happens when my dog (a chihuahua) barks non stop, I feel the need to yell, cry, hit something (usually me) and it won’t stop even when he stops barking. I don’t know what to do. After dinner I went downstairs to have a shower and just,,, curled up and twitched like something was wrong. After my shower it didn’t get any better so I got changed and sat on my bed with a towel over my head, it was dark and it helped, I don’t know what to do. I can’t talk to my mom because she’s a firm believer in the law of attraction and whatever you give out you get in return so I tell her I need a mental health day she says it’s all in my head and to get on with it. I don’t know what to do, I want it to stop."
I need help,Is there anyone on here who has existing mental health problems or is knowledgeable on the subject that I could talk to as I think I may need professional help but I would like to chat to someone to make sure I’m not wasting someone’s time
Is therapy worth trying?,I’ve been questioning my thoughts a lot lately and I feel like my mental health has been affecting my life. I’ve been thinking about going to therapy but I just wanted to know other peoples results/opinions on it. Is it affordable? Open to any and all feedback
"DAE find mental health diagnoses to feel objectifying? The only way to see them as the patient is to separate from myself, which is dissociation. My pain, confusion, and struggling cannot be reduced or legitimized by a clean label.",
A dissociative state,"I just have a question, if any of you have felt like this before. Sometimes, it can happen in bed, when I’m listening to music on the bus or whatever, I can fall into this dissociative state I guess. It doesn’t happen very often, but it usually happens when I’m tired. I kind of enjoy it, actually. It’s very hard to explain, but here goes: 

It feels like I’m in this big space, almost like I’m floating in space, but kind of also like I’m in this big warehouse that goes on for miles. Auditory perceptions feel like they’re far away, but at the same time very close. It kind of feels like my head is in a bobble of some sort, but I feel like you have to experience it to truly know what I’m talking about. 

Do any of you know what I’m talking about/have experienced it too, and if so, am I right about it being a form of dissociation? Thank you in advance"
Being comforted/excited by imagining myself as something scary,"Hard to explain but I’ve always had this thing where I periodically imagine myself as something that other people would be scared of. For example I’ll imagine myself sitting on a bus and my eyes will start bleeding, or I’ll walk into class with very dark circles under my eyes with extreme weight loss, and everyone will observe me but not approach me. 


These visions comfort me so much and sometimes get me super excited that the upper half of my body jerks forward or ill suddenly stand up and pace around for a few minutes until the energy wears off. It will instantly elevate my mood if I’m down. Has anyone had similar experiences?


I will be going to therapy in a few weeks for suspected bipolar/bpd as those are the things that describe my other experiences the best, but of course I do not know if I have either and it could be something else. Its hard to figure out the cause of these visions, however

Edit: 21M in college"
How Did I Change My Life After Losing Weight?,"I want to tell you today my weight loss story,  how my life changed after losing weight. This topic is not about how to lose weight. 

If we go back to how my life changed after losing weight, we go back to the past I must say, I wasn’t very social at school before I lost weight. I thought I was so ugly and worthless. I was a fat man with glasses. And this situation made me psychologically worse. **I couldn’t communicate with girls and I couldn’t relate.** When I was in the second year of college, I decided to lose weight.

*“I’ve been stubborn about it !”*

I stopped myself as someone who likes to eat junk food. I’ve been stubborn about it ! I stubbornly abstained and stayed away from these foods. After a short weight-loss marathon of 4 months, I lost 22 kilograms. (48.50 pounds !) I dropped 78 kilogram when I was 100.

*“This greatly increased my self-confidence.”*

The actual event starts from here. After losing weight, people started to feel the difference in their gaze. This greatly increased my self-confidence. Psychologically, I felt better now. I also started using the lens after losing weight. So I lost weight and got rid of the glasses. **Now I realize the girls are trying to talk to me.** I started to get offers from girls who I liked but didn’t look at me when I was in the 1st year of college ! yes it was getting real, like in the movies ! All of a sudden I was becoming popular at school. Of course I pushed those girls aside. And I started dating another girl from school. Obviously, this sequence of events increased my self-esteem.

*“Now that I know, all my life has changed !”*

I was in archaeology when I was in college. And job opportunities were very limited. So I wanted to turn to different professions. I was able to enter the Police Academy, which is a written examination and a physical examination requirement. I had to see him in my eyes well to get into the police academy. That’s why I had surgery in my eyes and I got rid of the lens too.  I was going to graduate as senior officer, not as regular police officer. And it was a very cool and difficult success in my country.

I won the exam and went to the police academy. In the meantime, I could not run with my beloved in school and we left friendly. After school is finished i was appointed to a different city and started working as a commissioner. I started working in the smuggling unit, which is a cool unit, wearing civilian clothes. I’m not someone who likes to wear a uniform anyway. After some success in business life, I met a girl with a lawyer. She is the love of my life. Our ideas, thoughts and hobbies were the same. We had a lot in common. Everything went great and after 1.5 years, we got married last August 2018 ! Now that I know, all my life has changed !

**Now I want to ask you !**

If I didn’t lose weight, could I find the love of my life ? Could I be able to do my favorite job ?

You know very well what the answer is.

*“I would never have met the woman i was married.”*

Yes being overweight is not a big problem but it is really blocking us to do some things. If I didn’t lose weight, I wouldn’t be a police officer because of physical barriers. After losing weight, being a cop and being assigned to a different city made me meet my wife now. so if I had not lost weight I would be in another city, i would be in a different job and i would never have met the woman i was married to. In short, who says that losing weight does not affect human life is lying ! I hope my story will inspire you. My goal is to encourage and encourage people who want to lose weight. If you have detailed questions about my weight loss story, i can answer these questions. 

I hope you liked my weight loss story I wish a happy and healthy day. You can also read my article about how I lost weight here: (my menu, before-after photos etc...)

in 4 days i'll be 3 months clean from SH. should I break the streak?,my apologies if this isn't an appropriate post but I have nowhere to let it out. most days I don't feel real:(
Strange urge.,I want to bring my anti-psychotic medication to school then dump it all in the school toilets. Then throw away the bottle. I feel like it's to risky to dispose of at home for whatever reason but yeah. It's a very strong urge. I don't know...
"Honor and Disability checks, were's my premium?","Alas, I bathe and scrub of the scum but the shame remains, lads.  I've become a goodman from my youth.  My only shame is petty theft and letting loose on those whores.  My word, I broke down and had something to prove after I was challenged, provoked.  A prophylatic was used, but, afterwards, years later, after OIF. Man, those girls still haunt me.  Everything was consensual and sensual, I fuck like a beast.
A Man's name and honor and measure is on the line at times.  This world just ain't my mother fucking butter.  I try to be right and good and things and not bring myself dishonor. Surnames and things are not a big deal to people these days, nobility, aristocracy, yadada.  People are animal and there were Nobles.  Anywho, I was of the Duncan, Donnachaidh, Eisen Clan, Stark Clan, Vanadis? I do not understand how I am supposed to just cope when all of this information is surging into my brain from the aether.  
I shouldn't be silenced, I abide and know diplomacy.  I wake and everything is all pre-emptive, fucked up nightmare.  Fratricide seems to be part of the fam, I don't know.  I like to go to the Krieg Spiel and then just draw blanks throughout the ages like I'm some obstacle to these individuals. I don't know their plans or thinking, perhaps... They've gone... Full retard.
Folks, it's rough, I can't compensate for the atrocity and horror in this world.  I am someone who cares for this species.  A voice.  A soldier, A warrior, An American. Boo.  Our morale is shit anymore, our government is awry.  Our rights and privledges are not to be taken for granted.  We've reached a point of Anarchy like the kids want, Jesus Christ.  I'm not 12, I am not a gangster.  I'm a mother fucking cosmic policeman coming to get your ass.


Fuck withches. 
Have fun, enjoy yourselves.  I remenise of the great halls of Valhall.  
My home.  You can't click your hills together or suck dick to get there or any of that pussy ass shit to get there.  You got to have seen some shit.  I've seen some shit.

I'll make it real!  No culture.  No healthcare either, god damn, geto.

Pittsburgh - Local Mental Health Meetup,"Hey there,

I have been looking for a local mental health peer group and havent had much success. I was thinking about trying to get one started. Probably along the lines of Emotions Anonymous, Depression Anonymous, or GROW. Would anyone be down to meet up and just talk about stuff over coffee in a group setting?"
My mind is feeling so much healthier after doing these things,"I just wanted to share some choices that I have made that have led to me feeling ten times better about myself and just overall more satisfied in life.  These are probably super common sense but idk it might help someone so to me it's worth sharing:

-got a full time job: i didn't have anything to do after graduating college so for a couple months I was feeling down and isolated. Now it's something to do everyday and I feel like I have a purpose because the goal of the job is to help families in poverty

-pushing myself to do things alone: I know this sounds so irrational but I've always been so afraid of going to the gym and lifting weights because I worry I'm doing it wrong or lifting ten pounders and looking dumb. Its still super uncomfortable but I've been doing it anyways and i feel so good after 

-reconnecting with true friends, even if it means taking a drive: where I live right now I don't necessarily have the most fufilling friendships. So I drove a couple hours to my hometown to see my best friends. Haven't laughed like that in months

-healing/forgiving in strained relationships: I've had family issues all my life. I think if things with someone are haunting you it's best to confront it and make peace with it. I've come to a place where I'm still Loving people, but some at a distance."
Ooops,"I gave myself a massive bruise on my arm, i showed my mom and told her it was from trying to pull something out of my closet and slamming it on the door frame. Hopefully on thursday she agrees to stay out of the room on thursday for my first appointment so i can talk to the doc about it"
I'm gonna end it all,"I'm a stressed teenage mother with a 15 month old baby girl. I want to end it all right now. End my suffering. Start over in a new life, where I can go to school without worrying about my kid or my baby daddy. So I'm gonna end things.

Goodbye world. Goodbye life."
My gecko died (more below),"My gecko, Leo has died. I dont know what to do now, I just feel empty. If you guys have any advice, cute pictures of leopard geckos please send them. Rest In Peace, Leo."
What do you think?,I get audible Deja Vu. Someone will be talking and all of a sudden everything they're saying sounds INCREDIBLY familiar even though nothing else about the situation is. A lot of times I won't even hear what they're saying right away and will ask them again and what they say doesn't hold any relevance to the feeling. It happens on nearly a daily basis and it's just something that is very unsettling. What do you think about it?
Supportive spouse in need of support,"My husband was diagnosed with PTSD, OCD, depression and severe anxiety.  He was suicidal.  This came to light spring of 2018.  At this stage, he's gone through several CBT courses, lots of different meds, a few relapses  and still in therapy and seeing a psychiatrist. 
I have done my best to be supportive and helpful and whatever else he needs.  At this point, I am exhausted and I don't know where to turn.  Even just to vent a bit.  I have my own health issues-fibromyalgia- and I am just taking care of him.  BTW, he just broke his foot a few weeks ago and I fear another relapse looming, all the signs are there.  I am at the end of my energy and I don't know what to do.  Late 40s, live in Ontario, Canada."
I really want to end it,I think about ending it way to much. I think of all the ways to do it and it sometimes sounds better than living. I want to get help but I am to scared to get it. I think either people will think I am crazy or faking it. I don’t know what to do but I think one of these days I might end up doing it.
Possible to lose weight on Anti-Psychotic medication?,"I take Olanzapine, the worst when it comes to weight gain. All my life I was very fit. However when I started olanzapine I became overweight up quickly.  I lost weight a few times in between, but it always returns back eventually. 

is it possible to lose weight and maintain it on a drug like olanzapine? 

Any experience?"
How do I open up to my counsellor.,"I have been seeing a counsellor for about a year now, after the death of someone I looked up to. It started as a way to get over that but then it uncovered a lot of unknown issues I have had, like ADHD and Anxiety.
I had to find a new counsellor after the winter break (I am in my final semester of college) because i need to develop a long term plan.
I have realized I don’t tend to tell the whole story because I am afraid the counsellor or the psychiatrist will be ... I don’t know how to word it like disappointment and disgusting together. 
So I am looking to you guys for help:

How do I open up more with my counsellor?"
What are you on?,Who takes what for how long and why.
AMA or help with advice/encouragement,"I’m 32 m that’s dealt with major depression with psychotic features - as well as general anxiety disorder - for 3 years now. I believe it all started with the death of my mom (cancer) 10 years ago or the diagnosis of hsv2 (herpes) 3.5 years ago. Been through the hospital twice for psychotic episodes in the last 3 years, been on anti psychotic meds and antidepressants. Have gone to therapy and am active physically. I’m a big introvert and being social is something I struggle with. I think depression will always be a struggle.

Mental health in college,What has your experience with mental health been like in college? How does your university handle mental health? How easy is it to get counseling or mental health services? Curious to hear any stories and experiences.
Losing control,I wanna break down I wanna let go I wanna let this out I dont want to keep this bottled up anymore I wanna lose my shit and go insane I cant keep holding it in I try so hard to be okay be normal but fuck its eating me away. These voices these demons inside my head they're tearing me apart I'm struggling so so much.. I wanna die I just I wanna give up and let it take over. I'm so exhausted from fighting myself everyday i just dont want to do it anymore
I feel like my mother doesn't love me,"I'm 14 and I know that may make me sound young but please listen, my mother doesn't like me talking to her for too long, I never ever have actual conversations its always been small talk, I eat food on my room because I hate being in the same room with her most days, the actual talks we have usually evolve into arguments and I cant think of the last time she said i love you to me without me saying it first, theres always just yelling and I hate it so much, I've had major self hate and suicidal thoughts but I cant tell her because she wont do anything about it, I want to go live with my dad but i cant because my sister had kids and is living at his house so i cant or else he cant pay all the Bill's and then the babies dont have water and electricity, I feel like I've never had a heart to heart moment with her, I feel like motherhood to her is just feeding and clothing me and that's it, I feel like I'm stuck and I cant get out, she took money from me the other day and told me she would pay it back and she will but she didn't even tell me, she just took the money. I hate being here, I just never talk to her because its gonna be the worst, I've tried to connect to her so many times but she just doesn't care about me or my opinions, I recently got a girlfriend and my mom didn't even care that I did but my dad was psyched and asked me all about her but my mom didn't ask a single question become she doesn't give a shit about my life, I feel like I'm living with someone who just cant feel joy around me, she is always trying to make me think my dad is awful when in reality my dad is not that bad, he drinks yeah, but so does she
I cant even have a normal conversation without her saying she has a headphones and telling me to leave her alone, im seeing it happen to my little sister, she is constantly being told to be quiet and shut up so all she does is stay on her tablet, my mother didn't raise me, the internet did. I say I love you to her so much in Hope's that she just would say it to me more but she never did, I feel like she just doesn't care that I exist I know I'm the middle child and I apparently get thr least love but I dont get anything, my girlfriend showed me what being loved is like and it felt amazing, I never feel this way around my mom, my dad shows love too, I get along with my dad a lot because we have the same sense of humor and my dad always asks me how I'm doing whenever I see him, I haven't been asked how I'm doing by my mother in years, she only cares about my school life when I'm failing and I've been sad so many times in my life and shes never been there for me, I feel like I'm just some roommate to her, I feel like I'm nothing to her"
"Mental health influencers, websites, and resources",I'm looking to follow or read some info about anything mental health that's accessible for free online. I figure some people here would have some great suggestions! Please let me know who you would recommend
"I’m worried about my mental health, it seems all over the place.","I’m 17 and for a while now I’ve been worried about my mental health and I’m conflicted on what to do. I’ve talked to a couple of friends and they’re telling me things and saying I should go to the doctor but I don’t want to go to the doctor if what I’m experiencing is just being a teenager. 

I have anxiety which has always been known to me, my family, and my doctor. But things I have thought were normal are starting to feel like they’re not. Explaining it isn’t easy, I’m not sure what should be pointed out and what shouldn’t, these things seem so normal to me, even if they do feel horrible. 

To start I’m not trying to “self-diagnose” on here, I just want to know what could be possibly wrong with me, if anything. 
Quite a lot I shift from a depressed feeling to a up and jumpy, excited feeling. The depressed feeling can be  really bad, the worst part will normally last about 1-2 weeks. I will feel like everything’s hopeless and start to think of a world without me. This is extremely horrible, especially when the day before I could feel on top of the world. When like this sometimes, not an enormous amount though, I will hear things that aren’t there. This isn’t just voices, it can be car sounds, animals making noises, or just everyday city sounds. This i knew wasn’t normal, but since it didn’t happen a lot I kinda just dealt with it. 

On the other side there’s time’s when I’m seen as being overly happy and I’ve noticed that it can happen at times that I shouldn’t be happy, even if it’s a sad thing, I will feel happy but knowing that I’m sad at the same time if that makes sense. When I say happy I don’t just mean “oh today was a good day” I mean “ today was an excellent day. I can do anything”. It’s hard to explain properly why this happens. But like I said it can be at time that maybe be inappropriate, for Instance, I lost contact with my sister about a year ago and when I realised I sort of felt on an huge high. I went out more, started different hobbies and just enjoyed random things more. I felt extremely sad about the situation and it always felt there, but I wasn’t upset the way my family was. This was until a couple weeks went by and I went into a depressive feeling, I had a breakdown about it. I begged my friend to let me die and I started hating myself cause my sister was gone. Again everything felt hopeless.

Right now I’m in a mixed feeling, I feel happy but at the same time sad, it’s a weird feeling to explain. It’s kind of like listening to a song you love or doing something you love but has sad memories with it, if that makes sense. 

I know this has been quite long and I appreciate you reading this, if you have any advice or even similar experiences please comment. Hopefully I might gain some insight(without the self diagnosing)

Thank you!"
"I think I might have anxiety, but I also feel like I’m just a little awkward, or stressed, I just don’t know.","Tw: self harm/sucidal thoughts 

This question has been in the back of my mind for months, maybe years now but I couldn’t ask anyone in my real life, so I’m here asking the question.

For the past year and a half I’ve gone really down hill. I’m a 16 year old and I live in England so I’m getting close to my GCSEs and it was around the time I started my course that I felt like I am now, so it could realistically just be the stress of school that’s causing me to feel the way I do.

Pretty much all I’ve been feeling is sad, stressed, angry and worried. There a few moments of happiness but they go very quickly and they are few and far between. So many times when I’ve tried to get off my phone and try do some homework I’ve either given up after 10 minutes or produced a horrible piece. So I always end up doing them late the night before or in the mornings they are due in a panic, and before this term (started in early January) I have never missed a piece of homework, and now I’ve already missed two. My grades have taken a hit too, when I started my courses I was at 7s or 8s across the board but in my most recent tests I’ve gotten 5s and 6s across the board. Getting up for school has become almost impossible, it takes my parents to come in and yell at me with 5 minutes before I have to leave for me to even get out of bed. And the school day leaves me nothing short of exhausted, but then again I’ve started walking home recently so I’m not sure at all. But whenever I get home I think I’ve got a piece or two due for tomorrow I should do them early and get good sleep, but I always end up getting into bed and staying there until it’s time for dinner, often falling sleep.  But I haven’t talked to anyone besides my gf about this so it could just be a completely normal thing for a student to be going through and I’m just overreacting. 

Social interactions are always exhausting and terrifying for me, a friend of mine texts me ‘hi’ and I wait until I’m completely alone in case they want to call me and I can’t because I’m with other people and I don’t want to let them down again because I’ve always said I’m busy like 7 times before. And another friend wants to hang out with me but I just always want to sit at home and do nothing but I always go out because I never want to let them down, even if I have other stuff to do. The thought of slightly annoying someone I barley know at all terrifies me, and I’m always thinking someone I’m close to is angry with me, I say someone but it’s usually almost everyone. And I always think that everyone I’m not Close to detests me because I’m ugly and annoying. The thought of speaking infront of a class makes me sweat, and interviews (jobs/collages)  have the same effect.  But the thing is when I get in those situations I can manage them with ease, I’m terrified though out it but I do well, I got a top grade in a speaking assessment infront of the whole class, I’ve gotten every position that I’ve had an interview for and in a mock interview I was scored almost full marks. I’m not exactly brilliant at talking, because asking questions I’m always terrified that I’m gonna seem annoying or something, but I can always answer questions well, even if I’m panicked while answering. But again, this could just be normal teenage stuff and I just don’t know how to deal with it.

Also I’ve have something like a panic or anxiety attack or anything, I’ve never attempted suicide, even I have had many suicidal thoughts and have planned out how I would do it, and only ever cut myself twice. And my situation is so much better than others around me. I live in a good house, I get to go on nice holidays often, I don’t have any underlying health issues other than mild asthma that barley effects me, none of my relatives are ill, ffs I have a beautiful and amazing girlfriend. 

My girlfriend also has some issues, it’s likely she has depression and is going to get counselling for it soon. At the start of our relationship I used to get jealous, extremely and unreasonably jealous and it very almost ruined our relationship, I was just always terrified of her leaving me for someone better, because she is so much better than me, so I got angry every time she talked to guy, but recently I’ve gotten past that and I haven’t felt jealousy anywhere near that for 3 months. the only time I came close was recently when she shed new light on an old situation, where she was pressured into spending one and one time with another guy by that guy, and he got very angry when she suggested that she would invite me and he could invite anyone he wanted, and she ended up inviting him to hers, but it wasn’t here fault at all so I wasn’t angry at her, just the guy that she got pressured by, and I’m sometimes weary of him as to me it seems weird that he pressured her into spending one and one time with him and got angry when she said no at first.  Before now I only knew about him going round to hers just them two. Anyway, recently I’ve found new ways of ruining our relationship, because I always think she is angry at my and hates me because I made a bad joke, or just because I’m an annoying person. And she’s so lovely to be putting up with me when she’s going through her own stuff but I really hate myself for putting her though it. She’s so great and I just can’t understand why she hasn’t left me yet because she really is so much better than me, and I can never provide the support I should be able to for her, when she is struggling with school, or family issues, or people dying, I can’t never properly support her and I just want to be able to. I hate myself for it. I just feel pathetic in our relationship and my life because of all my issues and the way I can’t deal with them at all. 

My life is brilliant, yet everyday I feel sad, stressed or angry. So I hate myself for that so much and I get so angry at myself. Sometimes I get into spirals of self hate where every little thing that I do gets me more and more angry at myself and the only way to pull myself out of it is to go to sleep or wait a few hours.

I’m sorry that this post is long, rambely and probably made no sense, I’ve probably also missed some points out so if I need to fill in details, please tell me. I just started writing down my feelings into this post and this has what’s came out. Thank you for listening to me and any insight/advice about my situation is really appreciated, thank you :)"
"Please, Need help with triggered brother with unknown mental disorder","My family has a hx of serious mental health illnesses, but nobody has gotten treatment for them due to negative stigma and cultural beliefs that it does not exist. 

Thankfully I was able to obtain resources for myself, I have had treatment for severe depression and anxiety disorder for 10 years. Unfortunately my brother (25) has not. With our hx of trauma, he has never resolved them and his anger is triggered and lashed out badly at me periodically. We both had to move in to our parent’s homes for last 3 years for financial reasons.

Parents already made it a toxic environment. However, he is the one that makes it harder for me and my recovery. 

Today he says my talking loud on the phone with a friend in broad day light triggered him when I was allegedly loud when he used to work 1 year ago. We had since already talked and made arrangements so I don’t bother him again. However, he brought this up out of nowhere and started yelling with violent body language, forcing entry into my room when I blocked and started listing all the things I did wrong to him in the last few years. I tried to be calm and talk but nothing got through. 

He has no job atm, he claims he has zero friends (not sad about it), is very antisocial, has abnormal sleeping patterns, and is sometimes nice and sometimes angry. 

He threatened to scream every night this week so I can’t wake up for my internship (I don’t make income right now).  Today I told him he was scaring me and being violent and he said “Yes I am”, so no physical harm but I still felt threatened. I am 26 and smaller than him as a female. 

I am not in a situation where I can move out or have a normal conversation, and parental intervention will not be viable bc they are also not mentally stable.  

Any words of advice or maybe just encouragement? I am feeling very hopeless and distraught..."
Off my usual mood,"Context: I'm a 15 year old boy, who lives in the midwest. Back in 7th and 8th grade(I'm in 10th grade now), my life completely fell apart. My grades plummeted, my mom was stressed and overworked, my sister became a little curse and made everybody on edge, my dad became extremely aggressive and impulsive, I was bullied, my friends all abandoned, used, and or stabbed me in the back. It was a very dark time and I had 0 control over it. I tried to get rid of the pain by drinking, stealing medication, self harm and it made me super miserable. I almost killed myself twice, I was diagnosed with insomnia and my anxiety levels were out of control. Finally, when I got to high school things started to get a little better

Ok, now it's time for what's been going on recently. I've had trust issues ever since 8th grade, but I have a good, supportive group of friends, my grades got back on track, my dad calmed down, my mom got to relax a bit, my sister got some manners. I finally started to genuinely smile again, and I was in a good mood almost every day. But then about a week and a half ago, something happened, I don't know what, but all my enjoyment of life just, faded into thin air. It started with really bad mood swings(I would go from completely content and happy to extremely tired and depressed in the matter of minutes. Then I started having really bad stomach aches for no reason and I would get random panic attacks while I wasn't doing anything. Finally, this past week, I started having what seemed almost like flashbacks to 8th grade to the moments where my ""friends"" stabbed me in the back or abandoned me when Im around my new friends. I'm crying all the time for no reason when I'm alone, and no matter who I'm with and how many people im with I just feel super lonely and I just don't understand why.

I don't know if something's wrong with me, my brain is trying to tell me something, or what. But I just want to know if anybody else has had or has these kind of things happen and if they know what it it. All I want to do is move on from what happened and enjoy what I have right now but I just can't for some reason."
Online gaming and its effects on mental health,"   


TW: Self-harm

So, I’ve recently made the decision to stop playing League of Legends, a game I was obsessed with and, at some points, addicted to playing. I’ve had time to reflect on how the game has negatively affected my mental health. I wanted to make an open discussion post about the issues that online gaming brought me and what I’ve learnt from LoL.

I love videogames, but my relationship with LoL was unhealthy. I would obsess over it, constantly thinking about it at night. I would force myself to play more games even though I wasn’t enjoying them. 

I would put myself too much into the game, identifying with the champions I mained and feeling a right fool if I played badly. League became too much of my identity because I played it so much.

LoL has a very toxic community, with streamers and influencers that pride themselves on narcissism and bullying (not all of them, but certainly some of the highest level one). The abuse thrown at you in chat is a nightmare and even one comment would trigger me so badly, I would have the urge to self harm. I would play with chat completely turned off, but I still struggled as I would play with others over voice chat and have to hear their toxicity, swearing and insults, even if it was just banter.

This toxicity rubbed off on me. I am 100% responsible for my own behaviour, it’s not other people’s fault how i chose to behave. But I saw a really ugly side of myself while playing which i didn’t like. An apathetic, depressed, bitchy side would rear its head when things went wrong.

This is all my own opinion though and my own experience. League of Legends is not a bad game, it just hurts me too much to play. I feel much calmer having decided to stop. It’s sad for me because I’ve made some amazing friends through LoL, but I can carry on these friendships so it’s okay.

What experiences do you guys have of online gaming? How has it affected your mental health for better or worse? What advice would you give someone with mental health problems who is new to online gaming?"
Tips and help to help me communicate better with others,"Any help would be great, I want to talk to my friends but I never know what to say or how to carry on the sentence and make it interesting for them to talk to me and thank you for the help."
My anxiety and obsession over one exam take over my life in a bad way,"I am so fucking done with this world.its 4 o clock in the morning and I puked. 
I have wanted to take an important test in Uni but I won’t be able to make it. I am just not prepared enough and I have been studying for months now. I have failed multiple times 
I am so scared what my future will look like. Everyone is graduating and I am stuck in Uni. I feel like a complete failure and it stresses me out. I mean I randomly woke up in the middle of the night and puked. This just shows how fucked my current situation is. 
There are many things in my life en that are not going well. I have been heartboken. I had to cut ties with a good friend of mine, my current part time job is awful, I even gained a little bit of weight ( which isn’t bad but It makes me feel uncomfortable). I am in my mid twenties and I feel like I am stuck. 
I just feel awful and I can’t stop obsessing over this exam. 
It takes all my energy away. I decided to take the exam not this week. I know I will fail. I have 4 weeks to prepare which isn’t a lot of time, but it feels like an eternity.  I can take it on March 3rd. My friends are no help either. Some have never gone through failing one exam multiple times. They think I am just scared, but I know in my heart that I will fail. I can only take this test 2 times .. if I fail both times all my efforts are gone and I won’t be able to finish my major. This would be devastating for me 
I even paid 60€ for private Tutoring sessions for February just to make sure I will pass. 
TWhat frustrates me the most are these types of comments 
„ you are a Smart Girl, you have managed to Learn 4 foreign languages“
„ I don’t understand. You have been studying for months now“ 
Stuff like that triggers me and I have to hold my self from crying. 
It’s so bad right now.
I am so scared I will be a loser, with no job, no future family .. basically someone with nothing even though I have so potential.  I still now my worth but it starts to really drag me down. 
This exam has taken over my whole life. 
I don’t know how to chill and not obsess over it .. 

And btw to make matters worse I am an anxious person. I get Panik attacks if I feel like I am not prepared enough. Usually these panic attacks indicate how well prepared I am. I don’t get them when I feel like I am prepared enough 
Plus I have adhd and I am not supposed to take any meds. I have a fast heart rate . This means I can’t take any adderall since adderall makes your heart beat faster, which can lead to further panic attacks. 
My life is such a mess."
How to get help?,"My anxiety is starting to get overwhelming to the point my mind is never at rest. At this point I have no idea what I need, medication or therapy or both. Here’s my problem, how do I get help. I work everyday and don’t have time to go see a therapist or anything. So how do I go about finding time to do something about this??"
Anyone else with autism feel like this at times?,"I was diagnosed when I was 17. I am 20 now. I've had the help of Medicine and gained a lot of self-control to really control my autism, but there are days like just now, where I feel like SUPER AUTISTIC. Like things I say and or do that I normally don't and I just feel weird. I had my first anxiety attack today too. That was fun. I also got diagnosed with Bi-polar when I was 17 as well. I stopped taking my medicine and prob need to get on it again but it makes me super tired and I don't want to miss work to go to the doctor. I need to find a new one because I moved as well. Sorry for the super unorganized post. Anyone else feel this way sometimes?"
What condition does my grandma have?,"My grandma is not the most sane person. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but some of her issues don’t seem to match bipolar disorder. First of all, she is extremely addicted to cooking. She cooks 24/7 and she never stops. She always cooks so much food that her family can’t keep up with eating it. She also goes to soup kitchens and places where they give out food to the homeless to get food that she does not cook with. She also just buys ingredients and leaves it around for it to rot and go bad. Let me give you a bit of backstory about my grandma. She has four kids and moved to America in the 90’s. Her husband (my grandpa) is very abusive (not in a physical way much), racist, sexist, I’m pretty sure he’s a narcissist, and he is not very sane either. Even with all of these traits, my grandma still stayed married with my grandpa. I’m pretty sure they drove each other crazy. I’m just wondering if anyone in this subreddit knows what’s up with my grandma, if there actually is a cooking disorder out there."
Intense dreams affecting my everyday life,Has anyone ever experienced having these intense dream that have you feeling what you just dreamt is real? Does it affect your everyday life? I honestly want to know. Lately it’s been happening a lot. Just last night I dreamt I dropped out of college and I woke up to completely regret it. But my day was spent with little to no motivation to do school work which is what I love doing now that I’m where I want to be. I keep contemplating if I want to push myself or give up. It’s like the classic angel and devil speaking to you at the same time.
Will never be loved,I came to realize that I'll never be loved. I'll never find a relationship.. I'll never get married.. I'll never have a good life with someone. There's no point of living anymore.. Not this way. I feel so alone.. So unloved so empty.. My life is pointless.. I have nothing to live for anymore.
Where do I go from here??,"Where do I go from here??


A few months ago I finally worked up the courage to go to the doctor to get put on medication for severe social anxiety, anxiety, and depression.  I tried out a few different SSRIs and SNRIs, but everything made me feel worse and I couldn’t get out of bed.  We finally found one medication that was ok.  So the doctor raised my dose to see if it helped more, and referred me to a psychiatrist to get another opinion on medication and such.  When I went to the appointment with the psychiatrist, she made me cry the entire time. She basically told me that I was enabling myself to have all of this anxiety and that they only way I’m going to not feel anxious and depressed is to not stay in bed all day and avoid things. The psychiatrist made me feel worse than before, and like my feelings were completely invalid, and didn’t want to switch my meds because “med’s aren’t a magic solution, you actually have to stop feeling how you do”. So I left that appointment feeling like it was a complete waste of time and believing that my feelings aren’t valid and that I should “just get over it”. 

So at this point I’m not really sure what to do next.  My current meds are going to run out in a few weeks and I need to figure out what to do.  Should I go see a doctor to get a refill of the meds(my current doctor is on maternity leave so I can’t see her)? I know if I see a doctor to get a refill they’re going to ask if the meds are helping, and honestly they really aren’t. So where do I go from here? Do I go to a doctor and get more of the same meds I’m on? Do I just stop taking the meds?? Do I go see a doctor and say that I need a different kind of medication?  Please help."
don’t have the energy,"lately I have just not had the energy to be happy or cheerful anymore. im not suicidal or depressed, I just haven’t been able to feel truly happy. once again I don’t want to harm myself, I’m not suicidal, please don’t think that"
What is this I am feeling - affected all my life?,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I've had this feeling my entire life - and well obviously it's preventing me from fully living my life.  I don't know where else to ask, so I was hoping that one of you guys can either point me in the right direction.  Maybe you know what feeling I am dealing with or what issue I am dealing with.  I do see a therapist for other stuff but unless you feel what I am feeling, it's hard to relate.

&#x200B;

Basically, my entire life feels fake.  Everything, from friends, from work, from going to the gym, from playing video games, from playing sports, from my relationships, everything is fake.  I don't feel a lot of emotions and I feel like a zombie most of the time.  My emotions are muted and it seems like my life is just going through the motions.

Every once in awhile, however, I do feel something else.  I will feel this sense of despair, loneliness, a yearning for something, and vulnerability.  This emotion that I feel (not sure what it's called) is probably the realest emotion I ever feel.  When I feel this, I feel real and alive.  Obviously it also feels shitty, and so when that emotion really hits me hard, I have a tendency to shutdown by mindlessly playing video games or something.

But the thing is, I've felt this emotion my entire life.  And while sometimes it causes me to shutdown, it's also the realest emotion I can ever feel and so I'm not exactly in a hurry to get rid of it, because I feel alive.  Unfortunately, it can prohibit me from being productive, and, not knowing what to do with that emotion and not knowing what I can do to make myself feel better, I just go about my daily life.  I do homework, read, go to the gym, hang out with friends, eat, etc... basically go about a ""normal"" life.

But everything I do, hanging out with friends, going to shows, etc...always has this fakeness to it.  It all feels like a huge distraction and hence my entire life feels fake.

&#x200B;

So what is going on?  When i feel that emotion, what should I do?  How do I feel better when I am feeling that way?  Heck, what is it that I am feeling?  I have never been able to find someone else the feels the same way I do.

&#x200B;

I mean I'm doing what anyone else is doing, which is just continue with life and don't dwell on any negative emotion for too long, but I just can't get over the fact that the feeling of dispair, loneliness, vulnerability, and a yearning for something is the realest I can feel and the most alive I can feel."
"Serious post: I want to kill someone, idk how to stop the feeling","Forgot to add : I am no immediate danger to anyone, including myself. 


I've played around with the idea since I was an early teen. I have thought of the different ways, how I'd most like to try it. 

I feel like it's going to happen in my lifetime, I'm just kind of pushing the feeling away each time like I'm joking around with myself but I'm not. 

I'm not cruel or sadistic, I would never hurt an animal, I'm not sexually into it or any aspect of it. 
I just want to do it and be done. But I know I shouldn't start thinking like that or accepting that it's just what's gotta happen."
Lack of Awareness...,"Quick question, so over that past few months I feel like my sense/awareness when it comes to dangerous situations has gone down drastically. For example, you're crossing the road and even though you look both ways you still take your time walking and end up nearly getting hit, but even after what should be a pretty scary situation you brush it off like it's nothing. No racing heart, no thought of ""that was a close one"" just a ""meh"" whatever. Is this just me or something a lot of people deal with?"
I am not okay,"I’m not okay. I had a major relapse in my life recently. I went sober for about six months from cannabis addiction but I’ve been smoking again. Of course I’ve stopped now but Im feeling the effects. I really and truly struggle with loneliness and solitude, I dont always feel content. The quality of my life troubles me sometimes, and at times even when I want to feel good I just feel truly down and out 😔😪 I dont know what to do, I’ve researched and practiced so many things and Im finding it hard to balance myself again"
Help with anxiety?,"I have never seen a doctor for anxiety before. When I was younger I had little signs of anxiety but didn’t really know. As of the past couple years my anxiety has been horrible sometimes, it really eats at me and I feel like it holds me back. Simple stuff that shouldn’t make me anxious because I know for a fact I have nothing to worry about but my head reassures me otherwise. It’s just been taking a toll on me. I just want to feel normal. 

Has treatment or medication worked for you? I want to say something to my doctor but I’m worried about taking medication that might not work or have a negative effect."
Just realized something,"I am happy to go to the Partial Hospitalization Program at the Counseling Center, even though I don't participate in many of the ""Group""  activities they do. I sleep or write (letters and my personal story) or color.

I don't give one shit about getting ""better"" because one part of me can't see the ""sickness"" even though they have come right out and pretty much laid it on the line for me.  I know what the consequences of me getting caught again are and I still only give enough of a shit to ensure that I am extra careful and that I don't do anything illegal because my kids would really really suffer if I had to go to State Prison, where I am headed if I get arrested again. My marriage would be done. I have no doubt my hubby would take the kids and leave. He threatened to do that when I was just in prison for the past year.

Please don't be harsh or judgemental...this is really bothering me."
Feeling alone.,"I’m having a really rough morning and everything’s getting on top of me. It feels like nobody has any time for me - not deliberately, they’re just busy. But it still makes me feel shitty. Especially on top of everything else."
Being Annoying.,"Growing up I was always considered an annoying person. People always said it about me, to my face or behind my back. I didnt know what I was doing wrong. My close friends never thought I was, but then others would ask them why they were friends with me. 

Now I feel like I act over the top annoying to make it seem like it's on purpose. I bug people purposely so I can have control. If I'm aware then they think its endearing, or laugh along. It's not me being genuine and then them being bothered by that. It's me bothering them and them being bothered by that. 

But I feel like I cant stop. I'm always so afraid when I act genuine or more normal that they wont like me, or theyll still find me annoying when I'm mellow. I'm so scared of it. But I know I also push people too far sometimes. In my mind I just assume theyll probably dislike me eventually, and I'd rather have it be because of an act I put on rather than just who I am naturally. It feels like it's less personal."
im really really scared of dying,"since im atheist i dont believe that theres an afterlife or reincarnation so once i die my consciousness will cease to exist so i will cease to exist and i wont feel any emotion again, any thoughts again or anything again. itll just be nothing, probably less than nothing. i really dont want this to happen but death is inevitable and i have a pain in my chest just from thinking about it for too long"
A girl is my only pillar of happiness and confidence and its crumbling I dont want to fall back to where I was.,"I dont know if this is the right thing for this sub but I'm not getting any other responses from any body its affecting my mental health and I just want to talk to someone. Sorry if it's not the right thing

Hey, I dont know where or who to talk to about this so why not people I never have to talk to. 

I'm 15 and I have never had a serious relationship I didnt have my first kiss until about 3 weeks ago. I met this girl at a party she was older then me (16) and in college I am still in high school year 10. We hit it of straight away and talked all night, I was quite drunk and very confident she clearly liked it. I got her insta and the next day I messaged her. We talked on snap every day and new years came around. Any time I had had something to drink I would send funny pickup lines and flirty comments which she clearly liked. We met again at a second party, by now I had a massive crush on her for obvious reasons. She was hot funny cool and older. We ended up kissing sleeping in the same bed snuggling holding hands making out. I was on top of the world, it couldn't get any better. We continued to talk over snap and played xbox games together all night, I thought I had finally found someone right for me.

I was depressed about 6 months I nearly did things o regret now. I have recovered and made sure that 2020 would be a new me. I thought that was actually happening I mean clearly I'm better if a girl likes me. I was losing weight finally and with my terrible body image getting better I was becoming more confident. 

We started to open up to each other and she told me about her mental health and past relationships and stuff like that. We were getting super close. 

But every now and again I got this vibe that se wasnt interested. I know that sounds stupid but it's been tiring me apart. Sometimes I would be ignored for hours or she just would give super dead replies or even air me. I've been an idiot and poordd all my self confidence into this crush and without its success I feel like sh*t. I feel like om jot good enough and it killing me. I feel like she only likes confident drunk me . I've been spending to much time alone recently just thinking about it and my minds been wandering to dark places. I dont want to go back to depression I finally started feeling better but my one pillar is crumbling. 

I want to talk to someone but I feel like an idiot talking to my friends about it and I'm not close enough with my parents

Sorry for the clumsy writing and spelling mistakes
I cant convey my emotions or the whole picture if I had years I cant find the words

I know this is just like any other post about a crush and hopefully one day I'll look back on it laughing but rn it's the only thing I can think about and its painful

I dont know why im putting this here but what have I got to lose?"
"Does anybody else play video games to help cope with mental/physical illness? If so, what games do you enjoy and why?",
What can I do for my friend?,"I typed this up and deleted it several times.  Avoiding posting a giant story.

A young(18) friend is having girlfriend problems.  Both of them have historical issues - dropped out of HS, a lot of drug use other than weed, homelessness.

A few weeks ago I referred the girlfriend to a social worker when she showed up from out of town.She was given access to some resources.

My friend blew up his life sort of for her - re-dropped out of highschool, burned bridges with his family, staring to burn bridges with his friends including the one who graciously accepted them into his apartment trying to turn their lives around.

I have no idea if it will work out for them.  When it seems like it won't - she's almost gotten booted out of the apartment, her mom has almost come to pick her up, etc - my friend freaks out.

Starts rocking back and forth, rips off his clothes, pulls on his hair, pupils get dilated, starts crying,  mumbling shuts down, goes catatonic for some time.

Uhh...his mom wants to do a mental health arrest...I've talked her down a few times...I feel like it won't help....and it will probably blow up his job prospects that he has lined up now...he might get his life on some kind of track again.

If...she has to go....either to to foster care, her mom's, or a women's shelter.....my friend will flip.  Will want to again blow up his life.

I...almost have him convinced to see a therapist...he doesn't want drugs...professionals maybe can help him with psychological flexibility or better coping behaviors...

If it happens again.....do we stop him from making more horrible decisions, like going homeless, abandoning the job he just accepted, etc?  It won't take a lot of persuasion.  When he's like that he has no energy.  Stand in front of him with an arm out and he melts to the ground in tears.His family is content on letting him make his own decisions...but I can't even call what he does in these moments decisions....

All his friends want to stage an outright intervention - the ones still talking to him at least."
Tips for getting out of a nihilistic period?,"I’m currently in a period where I couldn’t care less about anything even if I tried, which I wouldn’t do because idgf. I wouldn’t say the problem lies deep inside me because deep down I’m relatively ambitious and want to do the best for the world. 

The problem is sticking with routines and having the motivation and energy to do the things I should be doing. I’m even struggling finding what to write here. Any tips y’all beautiful people?"
I dont know what to call this and its ruining my life,"I'm really picky. 
Like, extremely picky.

I CANNOT wear cool tones. Sometimes it's acceptable depending on if the color is more warm leaning or cool leaning, but if my outfit doesnt fit my niche than I'm ugly. I cant wear pants that are too tight. Also, no jeans. Ever. Unless they're an acceptable style or shade. 

If I end up going outside and I feel a bit off with how I look, I get irrationally irritable and start picking at my skin. I get the urge to rip off what I'm wearing. I feel violent towards myself. I feel like something bad will happen to me or someone I love. I thought my shoes didnt match my outfit the other day and I couldnt walk. I froze. I had to spend the day thinking about how stupid i look.

I've gotten better with colors. I used to feel sick if something in my possession was blue. I couldnt buy any products with blue packaging at all. Now, if theres a problem, I make sure to pair it with something that's a complimenting color. If its leaning more towards teal, I'm a bit more okay with it. The WORST color is purple. Cant stand it. 

I love orange. I love green. I love yellow. Brown, gold, white. Pink is okay sometimes. Red is okay sometimes. Some things are okay sometimes if presented well.

If specific things remind me of certain colors, I wont touch it. My meals need to coordinate well throughout the day. 

If a task includes numbers, I feel a lot better if it's in odd numbers. If I'm washing dishes, I make sure I stop dispensing soap on an odd number. If I'm buying a meal, I'll get 3 things. If I'm texting something, I'll do it in groups of 3. I really like the number 3. 

I need to make such an effort to be myself. All the time. Everything NEEDS to coordinate with who I am. I need to buy certain looking things. I need to look a certain way. I need to do certain things. I need to go certain places. I need to eat certain things. 

I just cant tell when it's just preference, or a problem."
Things will get better,"If you feel down, depressed, anxious, worried about something. Just remember it won’t last forever and things do certainly get better.

This is the case for myself. On the 6th of January my life turned upside down, very fast, very quickly...

I was in a very controlling relationship, very abusive and was always questioned and harassed about anything and everything. My now ex-girlfriend (girlfriend at the time) was going through some legal issues surrounding her children and her ex-husband. Her Ex-husband was very jealous of the relationship between myself and her, so he decided to take her to court and then gained full custody of his children, but unfortunately I came under fire from her for being the cause, when it had nothing to do with me. Her jealous ex-husband took her children, he claimed legal aid (UK) under Domestic Violence even though he was lying through his teeth (was proven) and she couldn’t afford a lawyer.

So she started to blame me for her loosing her children, which really was not fair at all. It progressively got worse, with me having to pay her bills, as she was paying for a solicitor. For some context, I kind of knew this was going to happen and I tried to tell her several times, but she basically had her head up her arse and wasn’t having any of it. She then decided to pay for a lawyer AFTER he had sole custody of their children and once there was a court order in place. Purchasing a lawyer then was too little, too late.

Then on the 6th of January, we had a massive argument (basically because I had enough of her blaming me for shit all the time and I snapped) 

I packed my rucksack with a few items such as underwear, socks, clothes etc, but in the process of doing so, she smashed my mobile phone and laptop. She then threatened to call the police saying I was a suicide risk etc (more of her controlling behaviour) so I put my motorcycle leathers on, jumped on the bike and left immediately and drove to my friends house (45 minutes away) as fast as my motorbike could manage. 

Anyway, the next day the police arrived and I was arrested for Criminal Damage. I spent all day in the police cells and was interviewed (which was hilarious if I’m honest). During the police interview, it turns out that she told them I smashed my phone and that I smashed the laptop also. For context, she had given me this laptop as a Christmas gift.

So during the police interview I was being questioned and the interviewing officer asked me about the laptop and I burst out laughing at that point, simply for the reason being was she had told them a complete web of lies to make me look bad. I explained everything and I even cracked a few jokes during the interview (yes I have weird coping mechanisms) I was released with No Further Charge (rightfully so) and I left, or at least tried to....

Turns out that I had a diary that I used to write all my thoughts into (mental health worries etc). Turns out she had given this to the police officers and they then arrested me again under the mental health act and took me to the nearest hospital. I was nearly sectioned but manage to not get sectioned as I had to lie through my teeth to be able to be released. So I finally was released from Police Custody and custody of the hospital.

I then returned back to my friends house (where I was arrested from) just trying to piece together everything that had happened over the past 2 days. 

Now onto the good bit....

I’m very lucky to have a very small group of biker friends who I know I can rely on, as I was broke and penniless as she had taken everything from me... my friends gave me a spare phone and my friend is putting me up for free which is awesome.

My finances are now sorted and it’s so nice to have like £1,000 per month that is MINE, I don’t need to spend it on anyone else. Just going to use some of it to pay for a food shop for where I’m staying and to put money on electric as it is the correct thing to do, because I’m a thoughtful person.

But I’m now getting help from my local authority,
I’m registered with a local Doctors surgery and everything is slowly coming together and I am so much happier for leaving that absolutely terrible situation. 

Without my friends, I honestly wouldn’t be here right now and I probably would have been found dead somewhere.

TL;DR Had enough of being in an abusive relationship, so left. Restarted my life and honestly couldn’t be happier at the moment.

Also, on a side note, if your partner is controlling, please I urge you to leave, run, run, run away... you may not think you are able to... but I managed, I left that terrible situation with absolutely zero cash to my name, but my friends were kind enough to help me out and slowly but surely, I’m back to being me again. 

If anyone reading this is feeling depressed or you’re in a controlling relationship and you need to vent, talk, discuss how you feel, I’m only a private message away, message me anytime and I will reply to your message as quickly as I can, I promise. I hate seeing people treated like shit. 

Just remember, someone cares about you and you should know that someone is me, I have never met you, I don’t know you. But I care :)

Would also like to say I apologise for any spelling mistakes and the possible rabbiting on and not using correct paragraphing etc. I’m using my mobile phone and I haven’t slept for over 48 hours so I’m sorry.

Thank you for reading this whoever you are :)"
I always feel like I'm never good enough,"I always mess everything up, no matter how small. Felt like shit and went to make soap from a kit with my boyfriend to feel better. I went first. The container melted in the microwave, so he didn't get to try and i had to scrape soap off the tray, then in an effort to make something good from my fuck up i turned the soap into a bar and it looked like crap and smelled nothing like i wanted it to. Smelled like, well, microwave. Can't even make soap. He took it home with him because i don't use bar soap but i could kinda tell he didn't really want to. I appreciate that he was trying to make me feel better though. It's just so many little things that make me feel this way and I'm not gonna keep ranting on and on so thanks for listening. I don't really want advice. Just a rant."
Bad place,"I don’t even know what to say, this is kinda me just clutching at straws. How the hell do I shake the feeling that everyone would be better without me. I can’t get rid of it. I lost the love of my life and nothing makes any sense. Work seems pointless, hobbies seem pointless. My mates would be gutted but they would get over it. My dads probably the only reason I haven’t done anything stupid. If I can’t be with her what’s the fucking point. I don’t care how stupid I sound I just want it to go away. I don’t wanna hear “time is a great healer” I know it is. And I know it will get better. But I don’t think I’m gonna survive the journey there."
"I’m thinking about seeing my doctor, but I don’t know if it’s a good idea","People have told me on multiple occasions that I should try medication, but I’ve been very opposed to it because I have coping skills and I don’t want to suffer horrible side effects. I’ve made it through 8 years of suffering and I only get better at fighting as time goes on. Recently though I’ve just been so anxious. I don’t even have a good reason to be, all I do is go to work and take care of the house and my cat. I don’t even have a stressful job, I like my job. The only thing I can think of is that I have horrible living conditions that might cause health problems. I think I have ADHD too and I’d be open to trying a low dose of meds for that, since it could be causing some of the anxiety.

I think I might see my doctor and ask about being prescribed something for anxiety to take before bed. However I’m worried I might end up abusing it becauseI’ve taken doses of Xanax before (prescribed) and liked the way I felt on it. I’m very prone to addiction, both sides of my family have had severe addiction issues.

All I want is to be able to sleep at night without having a mental breakdown right as I’m going to sleep. I have to distract myself with my phone until I get tired enough to sleep or else my thoughts start racing and I end up depressed and upset. 

I don’t even know if my GP doctor can prescribe me anything because I’m not diagnosed. I feel like it’s wrong to march in and claim to have depression anxiety and ADHD, but getting diagnosed would take many months and it would probably go away on its own by then."
I [22F] don't know how to deal with my mental health. (TW assault/suicide/ed),"I always feel like I'm grasping for air, so, today, I made this account to vent - sorry if it's too long?

Since I was ten/eleven I feel myself struggling with my mental health. My family had a big financial change in 2008 and me and my mom had to move to a poor neighboorhood and I had to change from a very fancy school I used to go to since I was four to a very low-income and bad quality one. I didn't adapted very well, I used to cry and shake everyday after school and I remember feeling very stressed and I was never bullied, but once I took too long in the bathroom - because I was crying - and when I got out I was punched in the face. I don't remember much from those days, but I still remember how stressed I was all the time, it's always if something squeezes on my gut.

Outside school, I wasn't having such a great time as well. I was assault a few times by the son of one my mother's friend that used to live on the same building as we, and I vaguely told her about it and she talked to her, but that was that - after that, I started eating a lot of junk food and ended up gaining some weight, so my weight began to become a problem. I also tried to hang myself, but ended up not working. My relationship with my mother was at a really bad place as well, I feel like it was because both of us were really stressed out, but I almost don't remember her being around and when she was we were always fighting and she used to beat me up sometimes. 

After two years, my family, mostly my mother, got very worried about me, so I ended up switching schools for one I really liked, but that was it, like ""problem solved"". The view of my family on mental health I feel like is a very specific one, because my aunt had a big breakdown when she was 20 (I had just been born) and ended up hospitalized for almost a year and it was very severe - she's okay now, she is bipolar and takes very good care of her mental health, - but I feel like they dismiss anything that isn't so extreme like what she had, so maybe that's why they didn't follow up - or maybe I didn't shown enough ""signs"", I don't know?

As I went through the first half of my teenagers years I felt always at bay, but I guess I was mostly content. I was relieved I had changed schools and my relationship with my mother started to change, she recognized some of her mistakes (not the way I really wanted, and it took almost six years in total, but better than I could ever imagine, she really grew as I person, I think). I tried to commit suicide one more time, on pills, but it didn't worked, my family asked me if I had took a bunch of pills, because they saw the garbish and I just said no and it ended up on that.

When I started high school things changed (again). First, I changed schools, because I wanted, two of my best friends, ""Laura"" and ""Tom"", were going to change and I kind of just followed the flow. 

The first year, I befriend a girl, ""Emma"", and we kissed, I had this sexuality discovery, but that was as far as it got at the time. I made a bunch of new friends, and, one weekend when my dad was out of town (my parents are divorced) I decided to make a little party for one of these friends, but it got out of control, became really big and Emma was assault by a guy, she never said anything to me about it, Laura told me a few months later. 

Emma changed schools the next year, we kept in touch, but not as much. We reunited when after we graduated from high school, she lives in front of my university, so we started to meet up all the time and I ended up falling for her and we had a kind-of-relationship, it was never official and we didn't 'do' much, sometimes we kissed, but that went on for two years. 

I was really chill about it, I mean, I wasn't in a rush to make anything offical, because neither she or me had come out for our families, for me, it's kind of easier, because my family is supportive, but Emma's is really homophobic, so she wasn't in a rush to do it, she wanted to be more stable to do it, and I didn't mind waiting for her, we never made an agreement, but, for me, it was kind of a given that we would become official when she was stable and not so dependent of them. Also, we never talked about what happened in my dad's place, I tried to talk about it sometimes, but she always changed subjects, she wasn't offended by it, but it was clear she didn't want to talk about it, and I also never pressure too much into, I never really told her I knew, for example, but what happened really haunted me (and her, I'm sure, it's not like it has more impact on me than on her, I'm not trying to be a jerk); I, to this day, feel very guilty about it, and it was important to me that, before we became official, we talked about that.

I guess it's not really a shock what comes next, but for me it was, she started dating, like, officially. I remember her telling me about the guy the first time, but I really dismissed, because it wasn't rare, we weren't exclusive, and I really didn't care, I felt like it wasn't a problem, because we were bound to be together, so, yeah, I really didn't care. After that, we broke it off whatever we had, we didn't have a fight, but I asked her to break up with him, and she said she liked him and wanted to date-date, so, yeah, we are still friends, she broke with him a year after that and now is dating somebody else. I realized that I had the relationship I had with her I had basically alone, I was very delusional, and yeah, that's that, not much I can do.

Sorry this is so messy? I had to contextualize some thing, because after this 'break up' I started eating in a very unhealthy way and sometimes binged - this actually began when I started uni, I got really stressed because my university was on strike for almost one year and a half, but after the break with Emma it got really worse. Not since childhood I was thin, but I was chubby, like 'girl-next-door' fat, but it got out of control, to me becoming really heavy.

Now, thought, I'm almost finishing university. This is my last year. And I lost a lot of weight, almost 30 pounds in last eight months, after my grandfather, who I was close (I lived with him more than half of my life!) died. I started eating healty and exercising and everybody is proud of me - even my father, who told me one day that nobody would ever rape me because of how fat I was -, I do all this healthy stuff and I feel like my quality of life got better, but I started vomiting almost every two to four days, mostly when I eat unhealthly, it's a really unhealthy habit, I know, but I'm a really stressed person and I feel better when I do it, I know my weight lost is not only because of the healthy habits, that the vomiting played a part, but I feel like I can't tell nobody.

And, finally, - it's almost over!, I have a therapist, I started seeing her before me and Emma broke up, and she really helps me, I am a very stressed person, specially about college, I'm very dedicated and I get really stressed because of it. Now, although, I'm almost finishing it, and I want to talk to her about the things that happened to me, like the assault, and the times I tried suicide and, now, the vomiting, but I can't, I feel like a literally can't, I'm feel trapped inside myself, like I'm suffocating myself until I give up talking, I never told anyone any of this, my friends talk to me about their mental health, assaults and etc. and I never tell anything. 

I, also, sometimes wonder if I have a mental illness, but my therapist never talked about it with me, so I don't know if is because I don't have it or if is because I literally can't talk anything too deep, as if I never gave her the chance to consider it. She knows some stuff, she knows about the party that I lost control of, but I never told her about what happened to Emma, she knows about my weight lost, but now about the vomiting, she doesn't know about the assault, but she knows I stress eat, and I never told her about the times I tried to kill myself. But I want to tell her, she told me one session that I have laid out a lot stuff, but we never went too deep, like I had some kind of block, I don't want to have it, I want to talk, badly, but I feel out of breath just thinking about talking, I really really want help, but I'm also very afraid that I don't need it, and that's just life, and if it is, what do I do? Is it worth it?

What do I do? I feel like a mess, I'm feeling like this for a long time, and now I'm wondering if that is actually how life is. I really want help, but I'm throwing in the thrash my therapist, the chance I have of maybe being better, I don't want to do it, but I really don't know how to deal with my mental health, I feel very alienated of everything.

Sorry about the long post, I put a lot of extra info, it's okay if nobody answers it."
Slipping back,"Hi guys,

For the last few weeks I haven't been feeling okay, I was on antidepressants for about 4 months but then I slowly took myself off them but now I feel I'm slipping back, my bad days are more frequent and idk what to do anymore, all I want to do is sleep.

Any advice, I dont have a clue anymore"
Is anything real?,"Sometimes I wonder to myself if anything is real or truthful, even myself. Sometimes I can't bear to look in the mirror because I don’t even know if I’m being honest with myself. I use to think that having another side that hides from yourself could simply not happen to me, but maybe I’m wrong. Every action or I make or thought I think is questioned by another side of me, it whispers and tears at my insides, trying to force its way through my teeth. Am I an awful person? Even now while writing this I question my sanity and if I actually need help or not. I feel as though I’m in need of help, but I also feel as if I have nothing to be helped. My friends say I’m beautiful and smart, but as much as I want to believe that I can’t. The other part of me says that they are lying and that everyone is always lying. I always fall prey to these thoughts. I want to rip it out so bad, it’s like a whispering worm that slithers and tightens around my brain. I just want it to stop."
Happy and sad at the same time,"I pretty much have the life I’ve always dreamed of. I travel to cool places for a job I adore, make good money to support myself, have significantly improved family relationships over the last couple of years, and have lots of strong friendships with people I genuinely love. I have fun hobbies and exercise regularly. And yet recently it feels like a part of me is missing. When I’m alone, I feel REALLY alone. I feel okay while I’m with other people, they’d probably never guess that I feel the way I do. There’s always a smile on my face, I’m a really positive and happy person. But I can’t shake this weird sense of sadness and loneliness, and it’s taking a toll on me. I’m in the middle of a 4-month stretch for work in Florida, which is my favorite part of the year. It’s my second home here and I’m surrounded by people I love almost all day every day. I should be happier. 
If there’s one part of my life that could be doing better it’s dating, but I don’t rely on a relationship or men for my own happiness so I want to say that’s not the cause for this. I’ve been single for 15 months after a 4 year relationship ended. Maybe I do still think about him too much.
I don’t really like to be vulnerable and put my real feelings out on the internet a ton, but it’s time for me to admit that my mental health is going through a rough patch. I force myself to be happy 24/7 and don’t face my feelings as much as I need to, and it’s coming to a boiling point. 
This is mostly just a vent, but if anyone has advice or opinions I’m all ears."
How do I talk with my parents about my suicidal thoughts?,"Hi, guys. This is my first reddit post, I hope you could give me some advice. I've been visiting a therapist for ten months and started with medication two months ago, but things are getting worse to the point that commiting suicide seems like an option. 
I was always an A+ student, but since I hoy depressed I cannot longer stand going to school. I think I've lost all my intelligence and it is making me feel so empty...
I've always been good at hidding my emotions and talking about them seems imposible. I don't want to worry my parents but I know that I need serious help.

Thank you for reading and I hope you'll have a good day :)"
Really struggling right now and don’t feel like I want to help myself,"Hi all, new to reddit. The past two months my mental health has been really bad, I’m really lucky as I’m a mature uni student so I have my counselling assessment on Monday with view to start properly the week after.

The problem is, right now I feel like I’m in such a deep hole that I don’t even want to help myself. Im doing normal life things, but they’re a massive struggle and I’d really rather just curl up into a ball. I’ve been having similar symptoms intermittently for the past 17 years but in the past 2 years they’ve been more frequent and the past 2 months they’ve intensified (not sure if it’s triggering if I list my symptoms). I’ve never seen a doctor about it but I’m thinking I might need to soon.

I guess the question is, what do you do when you’re so deep in the hole you don’t even want to get out? Essentially I want to live and live a full life, but right now I don’t even see how I can start doing that."
Military PTSD Comp,"I had entitlements and benefits and all from my military service.  A paltry 4 years lotted me some amazing benefits this day in age, in the great nation of USA.  I'm not being sarcarstic, the American military is all I know right now and it's a good package for a warrior.  You don't get millions for braving the unimaginable atoricites of war but it's better than slave armies, which are out there.  We've come a long way since forcing slaves to bare steel on one another.  We may be able to actually take some pleasure in battle in coming ages of good Federal and Vigilante work.  If you believe in a cause, it's out there somewhere, get your training and licenses, the world is yours.  I loved being a soldier, didn't get to do it all, got gout.  That's hard to get a waiver for on top of previous psychiatirc experiences and maybe being the Lord.  All is well otherwise, absolute unit.

I do not know what your fate or destiny is, it's in your hands now, mostly.  I try to be poetic, I can't humor or compensate for these soft peoples squishy brains.  

Basically my comp appeal involved rape, child rape, I saw some kids get raped in Iraq, it was totally fucked up.  Child sex slaves or something, it's the extent of inhumanity I experienced there. It was just fucked up, inhumanities, super fucked up.  Battle was fickle, I was in mortar volley's on top of me, quite a few.  Lot's of movement, lots of convoys and airtime, I loved it otherwise.  I'm sure my brain is fucked from that, I'm coping well.  I mean, that shit sure isn't natural.  Other than that I was radio, did security details, Noble Gaurds.  Do not dishonor the Noble Gaurds, their duty is most important.

The military is working on transparency, I'm not sure if it's corrupt as fuck organizations inside organizaitons, shadow work going on in there.  I am a transparent person, not going to make it far in this stupid ass society based on deceit.

I understand professionals EMT's, Police, have to deal with that, and I was prepared to deal with it to.  It's just fucked up, I was told to file, followed my instructions, and it was just insulting.  I don't know who these people are, fuck em.

I was briefed and debriefed, I mean, it was clear at the time.  I'm just playing along.


War's a Racket, I want my fuckin cut.  I am not a greedy or vane or materialistic person even.  Need resources, get some fuckin work done.


And that's what fucked me up.  Those were some repressed memories.

The human brain is amazing though, it's like rubber, not jello.  It's like rubber now, or Iron.  It's an alloy or calcified."
ANXIETY INFO,"Mental Health Awareness😘❤️💙

Clinically diagnosed anxiety is not just being a bit worried, you can't just ""chill out a bit"" or ""get over it"". It eats into your well being, your confidence, your health and your life and it is 24/7. When someone cancels, or ducks out, or makes a pathetic excuse please understand that it isn't personal, it isn't laziness, it isn't being rude. It's because they can't physically do it. When someone needs supporting/encouraging/ hand holding it isn't pathetic, it isn't attention seeking, it isn't childish - it's because they are desperate to beat it but can't do it alone.

Anxiety sucks, being isolated and believing your friends don't care sucks even more 😢😢. 
How many of you have had a night out planned, or arranged coffee or a beer with friends and suddenly the 4 walls you inhabit seem the only safe haven because it's the only place you don't have to pretend you are ok, so you cancel.

Or when you are invited out you tell them how terribly sorry you are but you're already booked up that weekend, when you are actually just really busy holding it together in your safe box. And so the first problem starts, all by itself.

People stop asking you and the isolation that at first wasn't true becomes your only truth.
Please don't give up on your friends. Ring them, go round, even when they don't want you to. Because they really do they just don't know how to say it.

And in work every passing comment is a negative, you constantly do more to get over the feeling you are not good enough. The exhaustion from not sleeping because you panic all night over what you cannot influence means you make mistakes, you live in a fog and it is a vicious circle.

You Are A Total Badass,"Struggling with mental illness is the hardest thing a person can do. People kill themselves because it gets so bad. Just remember three things:

3. Your illness is temporary and treatable. Make self-care a priority.

Please help! My friend Isn’t eating anymore.,"My friend never eats and he admits to it. He says he’s trying to lose weight even though he’s a really good weight, he could lose like 5 kg and thats it. He’s very self-conscious and I’m just worried for him. I only see him at school and he never eats breakfast or lunch and tells me he doesn’t eat dinner. For the past few weeks he’s been living off of litres of energy drinks and barely any food. The only thing he told me he has eaten was some chicken and later a small bag of candy, and that was after days of starving himself. I myself have a very strong anxiety disorder so I don’t really like to talk to ppl or go anywhere so I’ve never been to his house and I only talk to his foster sister through him. I’m too afraid to message her privately to talk about it as I’m not sure if she’s aware of it or not and I genuinely can’t hold a conversation with anyone. I’m afraid that I’m not going to be able to help him or do anything before he makes some damaging changes to his health. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you."
I need help.,"I am a 17-year-old male from Finland that's been struggling with depression and social anxiety for the past 5 years. They have never really been too much for me to handle, at least until recently. 

About two weeks ago I experienced the absolute worst feeling in my entire life, feeling weak and exhausted because of my mental issues. It was the first time I actually realized how badly I am wasting my life away, never being able to do anything with other people and always being alone, with the exception of my best friend of 11 years who I sometimes play games with. Now that feeling and realization is stuck with me. It almost feels like I have two personalities, but one is keeping the other locked inside.

I'm absolutely tired of being alone and quiet. I don't wish to be the most popular person in the world, I just want to be able to socialize and take part in different events, just like a normal person would. 

I know I need medical help, but I don't want my parents to know about it. Seems stupid, I know, but I don't know how they would react or how I would even be able to tell about it. I would like to know what my options are at this point, please and thank you.

Addictions and Disorders," After undergoing a traumatic breakup that i made up in my own mind and heavily expressed upon my significant and her family rather than taking it for what it was (a break so i can focus on my mental health and well being as well as her), I blew it completely out of proportion until I felt in my mind their may be no return and maybe even further. I can finally see what happened whilst not allowing my cognitive thinking to ever take part in my decision making. Everything i had done in the relationship and had been doing until this day had all been out of pure emotion, obsession, and depression regarding my guilt over the past rather than ever accepting the present and for what it needed to be (even though i felt happy it wasn't how i should have felt). As well as obsessing of this fantastic possible future i could have with her because of how invested i was in that obsession with the romance i had and could have with her. I am getting the help i finally needed for so many years whilst putting all this weight on such a young and impressionable lady who had only been kind and sensitive to me during the entire endeavor. So today after enveloping my being into that relationship (and hurting myself/and her more than ever was necessary because of my mental instabilities and disorder) I'm taking care of the most important mistake of my life and that was to ever start this disgusting drug addiction with poppers/maulers/whiss/whatever (tobacco and weed) 8 years ago. IT COMPLETELY SEPARATES YOU FROM COGNITIVE THINKING AND YOUR OWN REALITY, MAKING YOU SO EMOTIONAL YOU'RE BOUND TO GET DEPRESSED NO MATTER WHAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE. and by the video i'm sure you can tell how often i partake in this and the withdrawals i'm about to ensue :) please, if this sounds like you, seek help. I need a whole lot after creating misconstrued reality of my relationship and not being accepting to my own issues.

Help and reassurance needed,Okay I’m not asking for a diagnosis I know what I have but lately I’ve been over thinking reality and getting a uncomfortable feeling when I realise somebody else is alive like when I’m talking to my mom I’ll get uncomfortable because she’s alive and it’s confusing I’m not sure how to explain this sorry
"I think I purposely repressed my whole past and most of my memories because I was depressed, I did this for months by getting high and trying to turn my brain off, then something clicked and I fell into this brain fog dp/dr state where it seems like my brain is gone and I can’t remember anything.","I know I wanted this but not for forever.
Advice?

I think trying to remember and retrace all of my past experiences and memories would help but it just feels like a huge task and makes me sad and want to give up."
Starting to get scared.,"So I went to the store today. I was just fine in the car on the way there, but a few minutes after being there I started to feel weird. I was having trouble focusing. Every time I stood still it felt like my mind was being pulled out of my body. Like I was being pried from the world. This only really happens when i go places. It’s starting to happen more and more often. I don’t know what’s wrong."
How do I get friends?,"My(19F) boyfriend(21M) is my only friend. I have a couple very close friends but we all live in different countries. I go to university but I have no friends. I went to a boarding high school and there, this was never an issue, I had a lot of friends. I have since then developed social anxiety which does not help. I come across as intimidating and of having a big ego but in reality I am very much the opposite. How do I change this? I am tired of being lonely."
For people in therapy: what could your therapist do to improve your sessions?,A lot of patients tell me that their therapists lack empathy sometimes. Which I think can lead to therapists being judgmental or neglecting the actuals tools and exercises that people really need for improvement. What could your therapist do to be more empathetic or do to improve your sessions?
idk what my issue is,"okay so my self esteem has been progressively getting worse since i was about 15 i’m 20 now lol, and i don’t know where it stems from. i have a loving family i have friends that love me, but still there is a part of my brain that can’t believe that anyone can ever love me. when i’m talking to a guy i’m just waiting for something to happen to like make things bad. if i meet them on tinder or something i’m 100% sure if they see me in real life they will be disgusted, and i don’t know what i really look like. i don’t know where this comes from and maybe this is just like normal thought but i don’t know how to tell."
Looking for some advice dealing with my mind.,"Let me start by saying that this is not just a rant post - I am genuinely looking for advice. I'm very much hesitant about seeing a professional, because I'm concerned that whatever they'll diagnose me with will hurt my life/career in the long run.

I grew up middle class, in a family that I wouldn't want my own child to grow up in, a narcissistic mother and a distant father who left when I was in high school, as well as a sister who I share literally nothing in common with. I had several physical disfigurements, both from former abuse and unlucky hand dealt in genes, which led to endless bullying throughout my childhood, though my self-image is still normal for the most part. My face is luckily fine, so as long as I cover up the rest of my body I can pass normal.

I've been depressed and lethargic for as long as I can remember. Absolutely no interest in anything at all. Anything I get into, I'll eventually get bored and abandon. I'm slow, tired, and generally have no energy to wake up in the morning. I enjoy pretty much nothing, and all my day-to-day activities are designed to keep my mind busy, and time passing. I got into a university but dropped out both because I couldn't afford it and I was also too lazy to keep at it. I've been working since, hardly ever the hardest working employee, but I still work well enough. I'm not shy or introverted, I can function well around people, even make jokes and hang out with coworkers, but I still prefer one-on-one conversations or better yet, solitude.

I used to self-harm heavily. My right arm (I'm left-handed) is practically covered in scars, though mostly faded now that I haven't done it in years, and don't plan to. I often think about suicide, or just being a firefighter or something and dying a meaningful death, but I'll be honest and admit I don't actually intend to do it. It just feels comfortable as a last resort measure. I don't hate myself, at least I don't think I do. I actually think I deserve a better life.

I have episodes of depersonalisation, which may or may not be the correct term. Basically, suddenly I'll freeze up, look, hear and feel and it all seems familiar, but it suddenly feels like a dream for the duration, like watching a movie. It never lasted longer than a minute usually, but recently it's getting longer, and it can be crippling around people. I'm also heavily sensitive to touch and sounds, someone as much as touching my shoulder, or a honking car is enough to make me jump. This is actually harder than the depersonalisation thing because people often make fun of it, thinking me for a coward.

I can go on and on but I don't want to write a novel long post that nobody will read. This is all the important bits, pretty much. I usually just write all my thoughts down in my journal, but it's getting unbearable. I need to solve this out.

Removing regret is the key to recovering or improving.,"However, it's so difficult to stop regretting poor decisions.

I made some poor decisions over the past couple of years, and they lead to depression and anxiety and panic attacks, and the thing that gets me is that the things I did were soo easily avoidable, and so unnecessary and useless.
I feel like I wasted my life for months, depressed, ill, and anxious, and stressed, for nothing. 
Has anyone else learned to move on and have any ideas how to remove regret and the ""I've messed up my whole life over nothing"" thinking?"
Just had to vent a bit...,"So, I recently started scratching my arms with scissors.
And using rubber bands in school.(can't use scissors during class)
I'm feeling stressed, sad, I hate myself and I just gave up on people...
I'm not depressed or anything...I'm just bad with dealing with pressure.
I'm an intovert and I don't open up about my feelings.
Usually I hate pain...but when i scratch myself it feels...deserved and the feeling when I remove scissors is pretty solid.
I'm still oposed to self harm(I wouldn't recommend it to anyone) but it's helping me deal with stuff...
I know I contradict myself by saying I son't support it but I'm doing it...I still belive this is not a solution...it's just a coping mechanism.
I still hate myself(I even evisioned myself running in front of a car) but I would never kill myself...that's a promise to myself that i will never  break.
My reason for self harming is that I'm being bullied, teachers aren't helping me and my mom is just telling me to suck it up and to ignore them...but I can't...
Anyway, I know it's addictive but I'm not addicted and I won't be.
The thing is that when I was on a verge of a breakdown...it helped me get myself together.
I still don't recommend self harm...but in my case I find it helpful...
I don't care what other people think of me and my behaviour, I don't care about anything...but I just can't deal with stress...
I know I'm just a stupid teenager...but...at least I found a way to cope with stress and other stuff...
I've never talked to a therapist outside about my tics (they are getting a bit better). But I know I'm not depressed or anything like that. As my mom says: I have low self esteem. Aaand...I don't have motivation for anything...
But I would never kill myself because my biggest fear is dying.
All I can say is...I won't tell my mom or my GP(UK doctor). The only way they will find out is if they see scratches on my arms...and I don't plan to show them. Even though guilt about not telling my mom is horrible...I just can't bring myself to tell her...
She's a great mom...but she just starts to yell whenever I say something like ""I hate myself"" or anything like that. 
She just wouldn't understant. She would probably just yell at me to not do it again, I would promise not to do it again and then feel horrible and probably still continue...

Thanks for reading and sorry if I made some grammar/spelling mistakes."
Need advice/ help,"Struggled with mental health for years and it’s just getting worse, I need to go get help soon. The thought of going to by gp scares me and I literally feel sick thinking about it, I suffer with anxiety and other things which is making it hard for me. Is there anything I can do/ take before I go? I’m considering buying prescriptions, but there could be anything in them so it’s abit risky. Im from the uk, what can I do?"
A statement of my mental health,"I find the state of my mental health really hard to summarise. For as long as i have lived i have not been formally diagnosed with any mental conditions. That being said, i have been dealing with mind space that i personally don't understand. For that reason this post will be very disjointed as I struggle to summarise my mind. 

Upon reflection, from the age of 6 until the presrnt day (im now 19), i have noticed that i don't behave like the people around me and that i don't truly understand the people around me. For example I struggle to emphasize with others problem ls, while completely hiding my own. 

In social groups, I often take one of two propositions: either the talkative outgoing type, or almost completely silent. I often appear miserable and disinterested when im silent. I say this to plance emphasis on how I often struggle to communicate or interact with people. 

I feel i have these problems because i stuggle to understand concepts that seem so trivial to others, the sort of concepts that make or break relationships. See, im the introverted type, to point where im pretty much reclusive, so my interaction ms are very limited and my friendship circle is small and even growing smaller, as people just seem to drift out of my life. 

As far as these concepts go, the one that has caused me the most stress is the concept of love and romance. While a part of me may desire such relations and overwhelming portion of mind conflicts with idea, to the point where a romantic relationship feels fundamentally wrong, to the point where i believe i don't belong in one and should avoid for as long as i draw breath. 

It's conepts like that where i feel my own mind is fighting against itself and it's honestly just horrible, but yet remains a small portion of what i feel is wrong with my own mental health."
Just if you have time - cold rushes,"I guess this is just another one of these posts, but I would be interested to hear your opinion. 

Background info: I'd say that I'm pretty depressed. Let me be clear though, I will not kill myself. Racially ambiguous (southern European white though), male,  mid 20s, in academia, live alone, no friends, no significant other, no sense of family, and arguably the worst Christian imaginable.


Recently, I've been reflecting on my life. It never occurred to me that one could live in any other context that the one I have been living. A fractured family, bullied, bully, sexually abused 10+ years, lied to constantly, shamed and guilted for sport, no sense of self, humilated on a school wide level (people wrote in other people's year books joking of my suicide. What a memory?), no core beliefs other than: hell is real, God is real, and anything involving abusing children is abhorrent. Politics? They don't care about you. Morals? Probably Biblical ones are best. Other than that, I stand for nothing and am the product of that. I get high almost every night to stop thinking. Weed, benzos, alchohol, cough syrup, whatever. I can't stop thinking.

Anyways, for the last six months, I've felt this immense sense of impending doom. Like I am standing on the edge of an abyss, looking down. I had an ex girlfriend that I was very close to but burned my bridge with her beyond repair. I guess you do really become the monster that you seek to destroy. I am utterly alone. The song Turn my Frown by Two: 22 describes the ironic tone and truth to me life, if you prefer an auditory description. I have been led on again, and humiliated yet again. My only ""friend"" basically told me that I am insignificant in comparison to his others. I didn't think I was insinuating that he was significant to me though? Either way, I was thrown off. If my life had a theme? Lifelong betrayal and humiliation. I never cease to be amazed in the ways I can be blindsided. I truly is comical. I have an unhealthy assumptive worldview. Even my body is disloyal. I have a nervous system disease that leaves me paralyzed occasionally and causes me many other pains and discomforts. Naturally icurable, of course. My family is so fucked that I could never talk to them. If I said, ""hey I'm depressed,"" they would then say that they would kill themselves due to their failure in raising me. My family has a suicide pact. If I die, three more follow. Though, if they died I don't know if I would follow through. Should I feel bad? I don't know.

With this in mind, I have been playing with fire. Loading guns and putting them to my head, packing up to drive out to fields (how serene right?), engaging in high risk behavior, just because. When I do this, it reminds me who I am. You know that scene where Bane tells Batman he was born into darkness? Well I am like that, but with immorality. Bad people, crazy people love me. They tell me things easily and are always trying to take advantage of me. But I know. I know their play. And if I don't, I learn it. Sorry for the rant. I'll get to the point. Recently when I've been on the verge of taking my life (of course I never would), I feel a cool rush throughout my body. It soothes me. Greater than any high, more potent that any benzodiazepine. I just stop thinking. It's a moment of clarity. Before recent, I only experienced this after I had beaten and bruised myself (though I was disappointed in how weak I actually am). What is this feeling? I've googled it and the only thing that comes close to capturing it is ""cold flashes"" attributed to menopause or anxiety. I am anxious, but the flashes aren't a bad thing. I've convinced myself that it's perhaps the presence of God, but surely there is a worldly explanation for it. The cold feels like smoke. As if someone released a plume of it originating in my chest or head and traveling up or down respectively. Any thoughts? Perhaps the context of my life has led me to some panic disorder, but none of them fully describe me. I have been going to counseling and they allude to C-PTSD, but I am no soldier. Yes, the classic American downplay of trauma. Really though, I don't feel like my life has been that bad. You know people are tortured and killed throughout the world. It's not like I was a filmed child sex slave either. I am just trying to discover who I actually am and what is going on. Humor me, please.

TL:DR Cold rushes in brain and chest when extremely emotional. Like cold smoke. What gives?"
derealization,"So sad I cant put a photo in here ( I've made a photo of the sky) It doesn't look like in the real life ,but its at least something.It's like a cardboard,It doesn't look real.Ive just stared at it and I bet my face was a bit shocked or confused 

And I cant understand what I feel-Derealization or depersonalisation.(I know the difference) I think I feel both sometimes

and Im scared that in one day I'll just forget who I am. I will look in the mirror and ask""who is this"""
"Completely unable to concentrate, irritable and feeling worthless","Since December I've been feeling like crap, I first started notising it when I started studying for my finals. I was absolutely unable to concentrate. It was so hard to start studying, I only lasted about 5 mins before I started thinking of something else or doing something else. After that, it was impossible to start again. Because of that I started feeling that I was absolutely worthless, questioning if I really wanted to study medicine and feeling that I was never going to be a good physician. Realising that I don't like any specialty and not picturing myself as a doctor in the future. Bear in mind before this I didn't really question the fact that I loved medicine.  
All of this makes me super irritable (for example, being impatient towards my pets and hitting them when I get angry -- yes I know I'm shit. No need to tell me).  

Now that I'm studying for my next final this is all coming again, but stronger than ever. For the love of God I just can't concentrate on anything.  

I've discussed it with my therapist and he's given me techniques to study but they've been of no use. I just don't know what to do.  
As a side note, my mum died on July. Before anyone tells me 'it's obviously that!', I don't really feel that it is. Doesn't mean it couldn't be, but at least consciously I feel like that isn't the issue that making feel like this.  

If anyone actually took the time to read this, thank you. And if anyone has any advise or at least a 'this happens to me too!' that'd be great."
Feeling Trappped,"I feel trapped in life right now. I really dislike my job and have some serious depression and anxiety. I want to find a job in a field I enjoy and to move away from MN. But all this student loan debt makes it very difficult to stop and catch my breath to figure things out. 

As it is, the more I look into moving or even just a different job, the more hopeless I feel. I cant afford to go wothout a paycheck for more than a week and Ill be well over 40 before Im anywhere close to paying off my debt. Life just sucks.

There are places in other states that Im fairly certain would hire me, and I would love to live there too. Its just a matter of finding the money to travel for the interview, then finding living arrangements at an absolute minimal monthly rent, and costs of actually moving.

Im currently having to live with my parents because every paycheck just melts away going towards my loans and bills. I really dont see the point of life if Im going to have to spend all of my youth working a job I hate, being a slave to debt. I wish I had told my parents to screw off back when they refused to let me leave the state for the college I wanted to go to."
30 years old and lonely,
6 months gone tw,"i have to vent because i have no one to talk to about this.
i just hurt myself for the first time in 6 months and i finally feel something. i was overwhelmed with anxiety and this frustration and rage and i just needed an outlet so i fucked up and relapsed.
but the thing is, i finally feel hunger and how actually exhausted i am. like i haven't felt hungry in weeks and ive just kinda been walking on autopilot with this underlying anxiety and now i feel almost like an eerie calm.
and i know it wont last, i know selfharm never solves anything. ive been doing it on and off for 10 years but i finally feel something and the fact that it wont last and theres nothing i can do about it kills me."
I think I might need help,"So here I am talking about my creepy habit of stalking. I'm doing it unconsciously and it's creeping me out, and it's not like it's some candid search for a person I want to know about or something, I'm starting to get better at it and it's weird. (today I found a person by their facial features in almost 10 minutes only and it's scary)

And I also have this urge for checking people's phones. Whenever I get the chance I'm breaking into their privacy, I'm lurking through their texts, pictures, I like to get to know them at a deeper level. It's not like I'm doing anything against them with that information, I just like finding out personal stuff, I just want to get to know them better. I know this is some sick way of getting to know someone, but at least I am aware of it.
Like yesterday my best friend stayed over the night and while she was asleep I broke into her phone and I just went through it, it made me feel so good, because I haven't talked to her in a while and I felt that if I looked through her phone I'll find something she doesn't talk to me about, or something she only keeps for herself.

And I'd like to know...How can I get rid of it..?
I'm starting to be afraid of myself."
Struggling,"Hi, 
I’m 25 now, still battling the urge to do something Crazy like get a piercing, hook up with someone I know I don’t have a future with, shaving off my hair or hitting my head/hand against a wall when I’m anxious. Still battling suicidal thoughts, inability to commit to a relationship, walking around feeling people are starring at me, worthless tired, drinking, smoking & just anything that’ll make me feel the pain less. 
I can’t afford therapy now & this has been with me since I was a kid from cutting my wrists as a kid, mixing a poisonous drink but didn’t go through with that to telling myself I have 5 years to live. 
I can’t afford therapy right now so if there’s anyone I could talk to who can help me a bit till I can afford help."
I should have been happy,"I was looking forward to the Party at my place yesterday. They all laughed and had fun; I laughed with them. But it was just a reflex that honestly hurt and didnt bring any joy. Come to think of it, laughing almost never brought real joy. I mean, I always knew something was wrong with me, I didnt exactly fit between the others(thats edgy), lots of anger issues and bullying as kid, feelkng disproportionate emotions, being clingy etc. 

Is that normal?"
I... what just happened?,"I'm often dissassociating. I'm always dissassociating, or at least I'm assuming I am, and my surroundings don't feel real and I don't feel like my body is mine. 

However, it gets REALLY weird sometimes, and it gets incredibly intense. 

I really didn't want to go to church, as I often do, since I see it as pointless. I'm fifteen by the way. So, instead of being in the building, I decided to go outside and walk out into a field and just chill out in the cold, since I'm not too affected by it. My brother came out after me to bring me back inside, even though I didn't want to be in there. 

However, while he was trying to convince me to go back inside, I just kind of... fell off. 

I got a really intense feeling of my surroundings not being real and I didn't recognize who he was, or where I was, or what was even going on. I remember backing away from him in confusion, though he was trying to talk to me. He didn't seem to be particularly alarmed, but I sure was. 

It was like... I was looking through a computer screen or something like that. I couldn't feel anything, and my head was blank. I do remember thinking 'who are you' as I was looking at my brother. This feeling only lasted for about 10 seconds, but it was absolutely frightening. It's happened before, I believe, but not at this intensity. 

It still took me about 5 minutes to really recognize who I was, though. ""Who is *my name*? Why are you calling me that?"" was really the only thing running though my mind.

I often just call myself something other than my name, internally, since it feels better than calling myself by my actual name. Hearing my name makes me uncomfortable, yet I'm indifferent about looking in the mirror since I'm so disconnected from myself that I don't really recognize it as my own reflection. 

I know I probably shouldn't be asking the internet about these kinds of questions, but i'm... very confused. Is dissassociation even able to get that intense?."
Psyq or psyc?,"Should i go to the psychiatrist or to the psychologist? (Sorry for the bad spelling)
I've always had clear what i had (the starter pack: depression, anhedonia, bipolar disorder and social anxiety. All of em in variant degrees), and I really don't have that much money to spend so I need to get that shit outta my head going to only one of them. Y would say ""go to the psychiatrist and get meds, then you don't have to speak to a stranger every week"", but I'm feeling like im not in control anymore.
This friday something really not that important happened to a friend, but being the overthinking dork that i am, I made a whole world out of it, being called gilipollas (spanish word for asshole/imbecile) by her in the process. It just doesn't feel right, I was so fucking worried and then she just said that she was ok all along and called me an asshole for sending a message to her mother to check how she was doing.

Context: we are 15 and we were on a party. It was her first time getting drunk and I really liked her that night. I wasnt much into her until friday but she was just so kind and fun to be around. Note that i had never kissed anyone before (yeah im a bit of a social weirdo and I have a pathologic relationship with sex). Then someone says: ""At this point it looks like shes gonna make out with OP"". I am obviously very sad and angry at this comment bc i was putting so much effort into not looking like a perv while drunk. Then she just says ""aight come ere"" and kisses me. It wasnt even like she was making out with me, she was like... Dunno... Blowing air into my mouth or something? Like, our lips were touching and all, but it was like she regretted it instantly/didn't really know how to do it (pretty much like me). It was devastating bc earlier that night she called her ex (that she herself left) and said i love you. Not crying or anything, in fact she was laughing.
Also, later that night, she was very VERY drunk (i served her last drink so I blame myself for it) and she wanted to puke but couldn't (thanks to the Almax pill that i gave her).
Oh, and when asked that same night about our kiss, she said some stuff that i don't remember. But what i DO remember is that she said ""gross"". She also said that she believes she also kissed some ""Iván"" (i certainly didn't see it).
I also feel pretty bad bc i didnt take her home with two of my friends. One of them went home and the other one helped her puke and pee. I had to take my bud home but if i didn't i would have certainly gone with them. It sucks because i feel jealous. DON'T ASK ME WHY. I just know that feeling very well.
Pd: before the kiss she said ""te follaba"" (i would fuck u), but I think she was joking.
I also yelled at my mum because when i went to her house to check how she was doing i left the door open and she told me (lying) that some thieves stole her rings. I almost hit her when she told me it was a lie. I need help. 

I'm still feeling more awful that usual and I really dont want to see her or my friends tomorrow at class. I don't know what to think about anything. Am i a perv? Am i an asshole like she said? Was she serious? About what? The ""gross"" part or the ""I would fuck u"" part?"
bitterness from past cases.,"how can I stop being bitter from past cases of treatment?

I've been told that it's wrong to have tattoos, or not go to church.

every time I try to forget, it comes back. 

and there are MILLIONS who live the same way. so why aren't they come down on? 

I won't be bullied or denied a normal life like others do, because I don't come across as ""chirpy"" or some other nonsense. 

how do I get over it?"
I'm close to suicide,I've had suicidal thougths for many days now and I keep fucking up EVERYTHING I do and dissapoint everyone. I can't take it anymore for long. My energy is super low all the time and I sleep very bad which makes things worse. I've been thinking of hanging myself when I'm home alone.
Honestly just disappointed and angry that this has got at my mental health so much,"So my ex girlfriend and I of about a year and a half broke up a little over a year ago. In my mind it honestly was a good thing for me because of the amount of mental abuse I endured and the manipulative nature she had that has driven me to have unidentifiable rage for the last year plus (never had this before though I have had bouts of depression and high stress). 

This last year for me has been a hellscape mentally and despite a great friend who’s been able to help me get through stuff I have continued to go through a patch of low confidence and high stress/anxiety and stretches of rage that makes me want to randomly hurt things and people (I’m honestly scared of myself sometimes.

The other night I met a girl off tinder (full disclosure I really don’t go into tinder with much confidence) but immediately I realized this girl that I’ve never met seemed to be the nicest and sweetest person I’ve met in awhile and I honestly fell in love, not a good thing I know but it was going so well and I haven’t had such a positive interaction with a woman in over a year so I think I just went too far in my mind. She really was just an awesome person to be with I was just too excited I think.

So after a good amount of talking we begin to make out and start to hookup for a bit (I didn’t start it but was definitely not gonna let it not happen). After about 10 minutes she gets a lot of texts from her friend who’s 5 floors above me in this dorm that her boyfriend had just broken up with her. She apologized to me and told me that she had to go (I completely understood though I was disappointed). She tells me that we should meet up next weekend (she lives an hour away) and to text her in the morning. 

I text her in the morning and she responds and seems happy that I actually followed through and responds immediately and I haven’t heard from her since. I’m still hoping it’s just a coincidence but it’s been too long for a coincidence, I’ve definitely been ghosted.

Being ghosted really isn’t the worst thing in the world but I’ve been in a bad mental state for a long time and this just feels like the last straw for my sanity. I’m honestly just hurt and disappointed but still just holding out a little hope that it is a coincidence. 

Thank you for anyone who read through this I know it’s trivial, but I’m just so broken already that it really hit so hard and I’m done with it."

I have weird compulsions...,"I always feel the need to check something a million times over. For example, after you flush the toilet, a normal person would just glance into the bowl to make sure everything’s all g. With me, I have these weird compulsions which keep my eyes fixated on it. My body wants to leave the room because it is clearly flushed, but my mind says otherwise. It’s an extremely weird feeling when this happens, and it’s sometimes difficult to click out of it. What is this?"
The conversation I had with myself today.,"One of the biggest things that has helped me moving through this current state of depression and anxiety is to talk to myself like I would a friend. I wanted to share what I said to myself today, out loud, in hopes that it will help someone else: 

""You're okay. Take a deep breath. Even though this sucks right now it doesn't mean it's always going to be this way. 

You're making small changes, and it's going to benefit you over time. You're taking zoloft, you're seeing a therapist, you're going to yoga more frequently, you're applying to new jobs. Things are getting better.

It's okay that you're still struggling as hard as you are, you've had a traumatic few years and an awful breakup that any good person would still be struggling with. It's only been 3 months, it's okay to still be grieving. 

Just keep doing what you're doing. This is an important transition in your life and yes, it's uncomfortable. But what you're doing now is shaping you so you don't fall into old patterns and old habits again. You've got this. 

Keep going."""
D.A.R.E. to do good Cocaine!,"Drugs and alcohol had  been an obstacle in this world for ages.  Some people resent drugs and alcohol one way or the other.  I enjoy recreational drug use and all, it's something I wanted to open up about. It's a sensitive subject, lives had been ruined.  People are going to do what they want to do regardless of law, of course.  The War on Drugs has been quite savage, I do not understand why there isn't more contracting in order for that, that's jobs.  
I personally do not struggle with substance abuse.  I go sober a year at a time here or there, I do not particularly need drugs or alchol to enjoy myself, I do enjoy getting fucked up though.   There are no lies in me, folks, I enjoy partying and getting super fucked up.  I hadn't actually experimented with a lot of drugs, actually.  

I enjoy cannabis a lot, it's always been good medicine.  I do not consider it a real drug, it's an herb with very awesome properties, sedative, anti-inflammitory, I love it.  Nothing helps me keep my chill like a burnin a doobie.  My sugar runs low, so I got to get my honey or doobie in.  Don't get to enjoy it do to it still being illegal in the great state of Georgia.  I have gout and arthritis, I need it for inflammation.  That cannabis oil stuff, I haven't tried it.  

I've done few other things, I've crossed paths with cocaine a few times, it's not my thing.  Somebody breaks out a crack cocaine rock and is just like lets do a bump.  I don't like snorting things up my nose but peer pressure, man, peer pressure.  I don't even get cocaine, it must have been bad cocaine.  I've done cocaine a few times over the years and never got high, I don't know about it.  If you have any good cocaine, I mean, I'm down, if it's in the right time and place.

Cough syrup is something I was introduced to back in the service (USA 06-10 OIF 07-09!).  I was a naive kid back then, I'm way less foolish these days, I've wizened up in my old age of 33.  It's been something I've enjoy the last decade from time to time.  You have to get that pure formula though, most of this stuff comes with additives that make you sick or bad for your brain.  It does make you a tad bit delusional, but it's fun.  It's psychodelic properties are noted and it's a lot of fun, I only use about 300mg usually, may push to 600mg.  I've gone to around 1000, basically a psychodelic coma enseus.  

I hadn't had any good shrooms either.  I've tried shrooms once and nothing happened, at least I didn't get sick.  I don't know about mycology, mushroom hunting is a fun adventure a lot of people enjoy on the weekends.  It's something I wanted to pick up, but, cough syrup really works for me.  I don't have to go into the woods, no snakes, no spiders.  I can play video games stoned on syrup and really enjoy myself.  I love this stuff around 300mg is good for me, cannabis like buzz with minor psychedelia.

I appreciate and respect people that believe in and practice sobriety, I enjoy getting fucked up myself.  With the gout I can't drink with my medicine, do to medicine reactions.  It's a real bummer, it's not the end of the world though.  I just have to abstain from delicious rice grain vodka I had come to love. 

As far as my behavior, I've tried to remedy my problems.  I understand my behavior was unacceptable in the past and I count my blessings.  I like to get loud, roudy, obnoxious, people usually don't appreciate it.  I'm much more collective now and mind my manners.  I usually just keep to myself anymore, stay in, play video games, no fisty coughs.

Lives have been ruined.  I've tried to better myself and I have admitted to my substance uses.  I cleaned up years ago and wanted to be a policeman.  I am not a drug addict and all, I am just a utilitarian type of person, a soldier.  I want to protect and help people and be a good person and all.  It's hard in this world anymore in the warrior business.

Sobriety isn't something I really struggle with.  Nicotine, Alcohol, it just takes some willpower.  Nicotine is very horribly physically addictive and it's horrible, just horrible.  Just got to chew the fat on those things and power through, eh.

I write up silly shit, blasphemy, sacrilege, act like an ass on the internet, sometimes in real life.  I am not mentally ill, to the extent that, I care about social criticism or norms or whatever.  I'm doing my best to cope with being the Lord and having amnesia and waking into a coup with these sicko ass demons.

Best wishes."
About eating...,"I need help. I've always been overweight, since childhood. When I was 15, I developed a mindset of a anorexic person. I avoided eating at all cause, until my mom put stop to it. I never had body of anorexic person, but I had the same mindset when it came to food.
Now, at 21, I started a diet. It hasn't been so good. I don't eat sugary cereal in the morning anymore or eat candy as much or junk food. These are good and healthy things, and because of those I want to continue the diet. But. My relationship with food and eating has changed back to it's former form in my head... I don't want to eat, I rather sleep actually. I only eat when it actually hurts due to feeling of hunger. I'm afraid to tell my mom that I'm starting to feel like that again, because I'm finally losing some weight...
Help me?"
Therapy Resources,Where can someone begin to look into affordable therapy? Preferably not in person.
My cousin came in and we talked about kobe bryant,And I level headed we talked. I got out of the confort zone. She left and now I want to scream. Why is that. I want to scream get out!!!! I want to be alone!!!!!
What is the best way to make it look like I’m killing my self but not actually have a threat of dying,"Ok hear me out. I don’t wanna be here anymore. But I don’t wanna be dead. I want to put myself to a point where to those around me, it looks like I was seriously attempting suicide where there’s no chance I will die, but I will be sent to the hospital, or something like that, because I DONT WANNA FUCKING DIE I know I need help but I’m a teenager and I’m afraid to reach out, this is an attempt at life"
I have a lot of anger,"TW: feelings of violence, brief mention of suicidal ideation.

I know that the kind of person everyone loves is the martyr who sacrifices themselves and lets go of the past, and forgives everyone for everything without being mad at them or trying to make them say they’re sorry because they’re just so healthy and stable that they just radiate kindness and light effortlessly, and people just naturally flock to them.

I am not that person.

I tried to be that person, but I am not. I am angry. So fucking angry that I want the world to burn to the ground. Anger is kind of blinding if you let it be. Obviously I know that the world burning to the ground would be terrible for me and everyone else, and would never actually commit arson, but that doesn’t change the fact that my anger wants to. 

My anger wants to kill all the people who fucking stepped on me and pushed me to the side and spat on me when I was a blameless innocent child. A common, but psychologically relevant set of experiences. My anger wants to shoot those people in the face and watch them suffer and fucking bleed out and die. 

I have been denying it, and pushing it down, and denying it, and pushing it down because I want to have a good life. I want to be a functioning member of society, I want to be a good person with a healthy life, and I feel love way more strongly than I feel anger. I love having fun, and peace, and reconciliation, and I know from experience that revenge feels a lot better to think about than it does to carry out. In fact, getting revenge feels worse than not getting revenge, and then you look back and see all the energy you wasted making something happen that isn’t what you really wanted.

I am an angry, absolutely ENRAGED person. I want to snuff out all the people who have committed such gross injustices. But I am also one of them. And it’s illegal and obviously wrong to take out violence, verbal or physical, on another being. But the violence has been expressing itself anyway. It seeps into my tone of voice, it leaks into my judgements of other people, it drains into my own psyche. The pain I keep pushing away refuses to not be felt, and if I don’t feel it, it will leak out of me and try to make someone else feel it. But me feeling it is what created it in the first place, and the fact that I did nothing to earn a lot of it and am also the one who has to feel it only FEEDS it. But it needs to go somewhere because it is subtly threatening to sabotage my entire life, and then finally let itself out by creating a situation so horrible by encouraging me to sabotage myself that I am finally desperate enough to let it out and wreak whatever havoc I can on a world that my own mind has convinced me deserves it. Either that, or let it convince me that I deserve to feel it and that I really don’t matter and that I was born wrong until I kill myself. 

I reject both of those futures. I reject both of those idealizations. I just want to find a way to release my anger and move on. I don’t want to kill other people, I don’t want to kill myself. I just want to find a way to be free from the rage while everyone is happy and healthy and not emotionally distraught, including me. Advice like “just let it go” or “just get over it” or “just accept it” all sound to me like “shut the fuck up you entitled piece of shit. No one cares about how you feel. You don’t deserve to be treated well, you have to earn it.” Fuck that, because I care, and my friends care, and my boyfriend cares, so if anyone has anything like that to say they can shove it up their ass so far they can tell me how it tastes. Because that just makes me more angry, and is just more of trying to suppress the truth, and the truth is that I am valuable and worthy of a decent experience. The truth is that I am just as good as anyone else. The truth is that I am right to be angry. But having a right to be angry doesn’t ever make it right to act on it, and I have fully reconciled with that. No cognitive dissonance there.

Now, I just have to figure out how to let the anger go without creating more of it, because that’s all violence and revenge do. Most of the people who stepped on me only did because they were angry and felt justified in letting it out on me. And now, I just want to break the cycle without being a martyr. There has to be a way for all of us to win. Any genuine advice would be appreciated."

"Kobe Bryant, and his startling effect on my mental health.","Today, the world lost a titan. It lost a father, a husband, a son, teammate, and champion. This morning, we lost Kobe Bryant. 

I don’t watch basketball. My opinion of the game is that it’s a bunch of primadonnas that take 12.5% of their total days off to rest themselves, have little integrity or determination. I can feel myself turning bright red with fucking shame as I type these words. How judgmental an asshole must I seem. These athletes train their bodies and minds to do things that so few people can ever dream of doing, and risk their health to do it. All because of the love of a game. And nobody in my lifetime did this better in the game of basketball than the Black Mamba. 

I knew all my life he was a beast. Of the few games I watched, of the handful of iconic basketball moments I have committed to memory, many of them include Kobe. Dropping 60 in his last game to the wild excitement of all the famous LA residents in attendance, getting to the gym early to work on his left hand after an injury to his dominant hand, his complicated relationship with Shaq, another all-timer, and of course his fucking GRIT. The guy was Tiger Woods-Michael Jordan level intense, and always lived up to the promises he made. There’s a reason we shout his name whenever something needs to be thrown with accuracy. He had a clutch gene like no athlete I’ve ever seen and a basketball mind to match.

I didn’t appreciate all that until I saw a tweet that just said ""Stop playin, Kobe is alive"". And the hundred or so emotional retweets, deep dives, motivational videos, and awe-inspiring pictures that followed it. My heart sank deep, almost too deep for someone that, again, doesn’t watch basketball. 

I’m at a loss for words. I know I have to say something, but I don’t know what. This is the best I can think of.

I feel selfish. I’ve been healthy for about a year now, but there were times that I wanted to kill myself. To take all that I am out of this world, irrevocably and permanently. Witnessing the death of a man that earned everything he worked for, a man that meant so much to so many people, is a sobering thing for me. 

Appreciate your life. Work hard and do your best every day. Today was the last for a man that was a role model, the gold standard for so many incredible people. He was a friend to many, as I am a friend. He was a son, as I am. He was a father, as I hope to be. Live and love in every moment, because this existence is finite. 

Rest in Eternal Peace, Kobe Bryant. What you meant to me in your life will guide me to greatness. What you mean to me in your passing will hold more weight than the world might ever know. Mamba forever."

I have had many different attacks. A lot of them are the general anxiety (sweating,shaking, heart beating very fast, lightheartedness) panic attacks but lately they are different. I am more sensitive to sound and i get so irritated by it. Sometimes i hear voices telling me to self harm myself or kill myself.
I also just cant seem to relax whatsoever. When i try to relax i just get so anxious.
Honestly school just causes so much for me like i cant even describe. I get so many headaches and attacks because of it.
I cant seem to stop thinking the worst. Im so pessimistic i cant even imagine myself doing well in life or being good at anything. Like my self esteem has plummeted.
I worry so much what my loved ones think of me like all the time. Im just so worried i will do something that will push them away.
I self harmed myself a lot and drank a lot alcohol just to get a hold of myself during my attacks. Sometimes i feel like im not in control. My whole body feels numb. Sometimes my arms and legs feel numb for weeks.
I cant even sleep because of my constant over thinking and anxiousness.
And my weight has been always something im worried about. I cant eat too much because i think i will gain weight. Sometimes i feel like there is something stuck in my throat so i cant even swallow anything. And im fairly underweight too.
I feel so worthless and useless i have no idea what to do anymore."
Please help me. I'm constantly on the verge of a panic attack,"I can't take it anymore. I'm on meds, but it's still always there. It's preventing me from even getting off the couch right now. I need help. 

Could it be my birth control that's making it worse?"
"Society ruined Me, I'm a great person, I'm the Lord. I speak the truth!","Sometimes all you have is you to depend on.  No religion or dogma or hope or miracles. I can't compensate for the cruelty and atrocities that people experience.  Teaching people some basic principles would help people out a lot.  Try to raise them civil at least, we've abolished slavery and now have independent thinking, unsheltered, minds.  Free to experience the world and free of much prohibition.

In my vision I was born into the darkness of the cosmos, I wondered the abyss for eons before alone. I knew nothing, there was nothing, darkness, I mossied on through the darkness.   The Lord came like a Lion out of the darkness of thunder and lightning.  This is how it has been since, he keeps it pretty impersonal for a comradery billions of years old.  That's my some of my oldest memory. A bit of the Angelic order, which seems no more - the Aristocracy and Nobility, w hich is also a bit ruined.  The corruption and coup, fratricidal things.  Some of these beings became fratricidal and some only care about propagating their own power.  I am martial, discipline and excellence.  I believe in morality and independence and all, mutual respect, democracy.

 I'm good to do guys.
  There is a realm beyond that which looks like another universe.  I just see the clouds, stratosphere, I guess.  Are there non carbon based life forms living up there?  These lifeforms are very dynamic,  multiple consciousnesses, multiple brains... Think of having more than one brain, what a conundrum.  There were more speceis and sub species.  The castes were destroyed and all bigotry and prejudice things.  Orks, Elves, Seraphim, Reptoids, Insectoids, it's all machugna.  There is only Man eeking it's way out of the tree's ascending from ape.  I guess beastiality is how Man was made.  We need one of these celestial beings to brake down and impregnate a chimpanzee. NOW WE ARE TALKING!  Make a real Man.

This world has become consumed with stupidity and ignorance.  I'm relatively well, just have some social needs.  That's some serious shit to talk about.  God, coup, demons, paganism? Norse myth. Neck beards, raging.  I know I'de been hanged, you don't gave to tell me what I know.

God Dammit.

What are some healthy ways on dealing with overwhelming emotions and anger???,"I would love some tips on how to handel strong emotions. Every time my feelings become too much I kind of explode, and I still can't figure out how to deal with it. I especially mean how to deal with the emotions in the moment. How do you deal with emotions when you feel like exploding? When someone says something that triggers you, how do you keep from reacting in anger or say something back? Thank you guys. This community have already helped me a lot."
"Can't find psychologists in Bangalore, India.","I started noticing mental health Issues 1.5 years back. Tried talking to someone over a vacation, but things moved to fast with her and I could not be honest. Thought will work on it once I move to a bigger City after college. Turns out India has only 4000 psychiatrists and psychologists for 1.3 billion people. So now in one of the major cities yet can't find someone with enough reviews.

I feel like the next chapter of my life begins with me conquering my social anxiety and self-criticism,"This may feel like a no-brainer, but those with anxiety will know how hard it is to finally try to challenge yourself. You constantly rationalize and normalize your negative feelings and if you have depression, you also feel worthless and not worthy of any happiness. I would constantly look around for things to frown upon when I finally felt a glimpse of happiness and confidence and I think that has a lot to do with what I've been through in the past. The bullying, the family traumas and being gay did not help. So I feel it's time for me to finally tackle these. It's my 2 months sober milestone today (no weed, no cigarettes). I think it's a great Sunday to start owning yourself and giving zero fucks. Love and peace"
should i put on a fake persona?,"i feel like people are not interested in me. i am not an easily approachable person to begin with. well, i can socialize normally with people, i have few close friends and i like to make friends most of the time. 

but, i always compare myself to the people around me. take an example, my best friend. i envy her so much, she's pretty and has a really likeable personality. the boys adore her, and the girls like being around her. we're almost always together so people might associate me with her. but every time we pass by together, our friends prefer to say hi to her than to me. our friends would rather have a conversation with her. even though we're close we're so different and it hurts me to know that people prefer her.

i am assuming that this is because i am the less attractive one. maybe if i were a little bit prettier people would treat me as equal with my best friend. or maybe i am just boring. i treat people kindly and i always try to be as friendly as possible yet i don't get the same energy back. i really want to create another version of me just so more people would like me. i want to be someone else.

i don't know if is it the right choice to post this on r/mentalhealth, but this has been stressing me out for months to the point where i know it's unhealthy for me. i often stay up late thinking about this, i even cried several times. i am unhappy with myself. should i be someone else or should i just stay true to myself? convince me."
"Tampa, Florida, USA. I made the call to Baker Act my brother Thursday night and he gets out today.","I’ve only talked to him briefly on the phone since he left Thursday night. He said this experience has been worse than his usual daily misery. He said he’s learned to not ask for help or at least find it himself before it’s forced on him like this again. 

He’s 35 and still lives at home with my parents. Hates his job, hates his commute, hates being and incel with no social skills. He said he goes to sleep every night praying to the god he doesn’t believe in to kill him in his sleep. 

My brother told me Thursday night that when our uncle fixed his car a few months ago and forgot his handgun in the car when he returned it to my brother that he had the thought to end his life as soon as he saw the gun. He did not put the gun to his head or even hold it really, he said he stopped himself and got out of the car when he thought how sad my parents and I would be and how we’d forever blame our uncle for the gun being available. 

My mom thinks he needs Jesus and my dad is just lost on what to do. Please let me know where to start with therapy and whatever else might help. Thanks in advance."
I am going throu another suicidal episode,"It's been the 5 this week, I am felling more and more powerless each day that I have one."
Ex Boyfriend took everything from me,"About a month and a half ago I was broken up with. He told me he wanted to marry me, that he loved me and all that. On the day he broke up with me he told me he loved me as he said bye and then came back and broke up with me not even 5 minutes later.  Saying he wasn’t in the place to be in a relationship and didn’t really love me. Throughout the entire relationship he made it so I felt like he was the center of my world. He made it so he was my sole support system. He convinced me to alienate myself from my family and friends so when I was sad he could step in and play the hero. He kept me from healing myself so I would be convinced that I needed him to be whole. He encouraged me to be vulnerable and told me to trust him with what I was struggling with the most. And then he left me. He took all of who I was with him when he did that. He convinced me he was my everything. He convinced friends I was crazy because I didn’t handle the break up well, I lost pretty much all of my friends in the process. Less than a month after he breaks up with me he releases a song about loving a girl in all the ways he didn’t love me and how she is his everything. So much for not being in the place to be in a relationship. He even made the cover photo for the song a picture of something I gave him. He took everything from me, and he gets to go on living like I never existed and never mattered to him. I just am not sure how I’m supposed to put the pieces back together when I don’t have anything left. My mom asked him when she could come to get my stuff and he blocked her. It’s like it’s all just a game to him and he continues to have the upper hand."

I hope I don't wake up after tonight.,"I've had enough. For the past few years, and maybe even my entire life, I've never truly felt loved, or happy, for all I remember. 

My parents fought with each other again, despite me threatening suicide, which goes to show much they care about my mental health. They told me they'd bring me to see a therapist or smt even since my parents witnessed one of my mental breakdowns 2 months ago, but they never did. They always argued about money, so seeing a therapist isn't going to happen anytime soon. 

Everytime they fight, I feel like my whole world crumbles apart, and I have no control over it, which makes me feel awfully crippled inside. 

I want to build a strong support system of friends and not feel like a lonely crippling piece of shit, but God just had to give me the middle finger by giving me abusive parents who barely socialised with me, which made me have low self esteem, social anxiety, and social awkwardness. So that ain't happening anytime soon either.

I don't even know why I'm sharing all this. I guess I wish someone would swoop in and save the day. But that ain't happening either, coz people will eventually realise I'm a bad person and abandon me, like they always do. Forget therapy too coz you ain't got the money to afford one, nor can your parents do so too coz they are always arguing about lack of money.

Ive been dealing with so much anxiety, and stress from school, which would get worse when I'm an adult too. Not to mention that in 2 years time, I have to enlist in military service for 2 years of my life where I'll continue getting fucked and traumatised. And they say that life gets better.

At this point, I'm better off being dead anyways. A pathetic weakling like me ain't fit to be in this world. I already hit my head a couple of times earlier on, I'm already hearing ringing in my head, and my brain feels funny, like it's leaking or smt, and honestly I don't even care anymore, I hope I actually suffer a brain injury or smt and actually die in my sleep. I even took a painkiller with some alcohol in my stomach, as a cherry on top.

Anyways, I'm going to bed now. Part of me wishes I would go through the night okay, while another part deeply wishes that I don't so I don't have to suffer anymore. Goodbye?"
feeling trapped - tw,"tldr: this girl mentally exhausts me, doesnt allow my alters to be themselves/exists, but she would get too upset if we broke up and raise shit. im trapped.

im beginning to feel trapped in my relationship.

i have dissociative identity disorder and my girlfriend wont see that nor acknowledge that, we have to try and act like one person around her simply to appease her and its mentally so so painful trying to do that.

recently everything i say and do seems to upset her, a gust of air could make her upset, and i try so hard to help but never get anywhere and its breaking me down, im having a really stressful time at the moment and having to try and cheer her up every five minutes is really stressing us out more. juno thinks shes a ‘whiny bitch’, mainly because she finds, in her words ‘the most pointless things to be upset about’. 

juno is my emotional protector. she knows when i cannot cope and shes told me many times now that she either needs to pick up her act or i leave her.

thing is, we cant breakup because of her sensitivity, shes said she’d likely kill herself without me, and that she was so lonely before and nobody would date her, and that she’d be miserable without me. itd be freeing to be single again but i cant deal with that drama at all. ive already got too much on my plate to cope with that.

matt, another of my alters, is gay. he is not happy in this relationship. at all.

thing is, with her its all or nothing, she’d get upset at the mention of an open relationship, and she would also get upset at the idea of just romantically being together instead of sexually. which is why we feel so goddamn trapped...

whats worse is she thinks we’re going to marry and everything in the future. i didnt have the heart to tell her i couldnt promise that. i know, im a pussy. but i never knew theyd be this many problems with this relationship.

im in a constant state of dissociation right now. saying i love you feels unnatural and weird..

i feel like im selfish and the asshole here, am i?"
I feel like I’ve said everything there is to say. Now what?,

Stressing out,"My mom is really sick, like terminally ill. She has what's called Gastroparesis, her stomach is paralyzed and she can't eat. On top of that she has many other issues including heart problems. She's back in the hospital again because she had a stroke, her brain is swelling. She's completely given up on living, she's an alcoholic and refuses any kind of help. If you say anything to her she just gets extremely angry.

I think I need help,"Location ( NZ, Christchurch )

I don't really know what I am doing with my life anymore. 

I have plans on what I want to achieve, like going to university in at least the next five years, and moving out in the next three, but otherwise I have nothing.

Since the year before there haven't really been too many moments where I felt happy, mostly just feelings of being sad or just.. empty. I'm not too sure what has been causing this, but it has lead to old friends of mine just drifting away and not knowing how to fix the relationships.

I want to be happy, but I don't know how to be happy anymore. Sometimes I think I might have depression or some other mental health problem but I've never been to a therapist, but I know it would benefit me greatly if I did go see one.

/r/Psychosis has a pretty Sun Cross,"The teachings are all there as far as spirituality goes.  You have to find your own way a little bit there.  I found myself with a sense of independence and survival on my own.  In the US we've established a sense of liberty and independence from religious dogma's, it's great.  While we try and remain somewhat respectful to religion and dogma.  It's a bit of a hypocrisy with these production companies making these really sacrilegious and blasphemous medias.  I'm not offended, I'm just saying, things tend to roll down hill and for some reason the blood of innocents must be silt while these big cats remain uncut.  


I was supposedly the re-incarnation of a deity in previous writings.  I've gone through numerous names and over the years have learned a lot.  Many people did not find my antics or humor amusing, and even were insulting.  I try to believe we could live in a world that coexists with the forces around us, non-carbon based life forms, E.T.'s, whatever.  Humans are still very animalistic and parasitic beings at best, over all.  We're working on a better Mankind and evolving soft senses of humanity.  


What is being Human?  I find these sensibilities and psychology very soft and non sensible to most people that have been through traumatic experiences, war, rape, torture, ultra violence.  Those minds are on a different level of coping and growth.  All I have experienced  is people continuing to insult the ego and intelligence.  I mean, practices in dumbing down people has gone the extent to just coping out to assuming people are morons.
Then there are other supposed deities, that are evil as fuck.  While all this pagan reconstructionism is going on and people are worshiping Satan or Demons or Pagan Gods, there had been little criticism in that some of these beings are just evil as fuck.  Warped, deranged, mentally ill, sicko god damn beings and they were. 

(Not that Satan is an evil sicko, I don't know him.) I'm not trying to demonize these characters, you know.

Oh, the brainwashing, that screwed me up a bit.  Appearently Loki(?) Can brainwash people?  Handle it.  I have no idea what to do.

 Like some of these beings were mentally ill in their own realm, like, sick, ok?  So these dogma's came along and I can not compensate for all this horrible shit, personally.  I had no control over any of this and am more or less used like a tool at the time and place I am born and know nothing.  In some of my visions I had been recieved, reborn, and sold or pawn off to a rival army even.  Like the Crusades, I was given to the Church and ended up fighting against my own kin, it's deeply fucked up and sickening.


Only later do I slowly start receiving mere glimpses of the past.  I reflect back on the old Norse Kingdom which is a place of hearth to me.  The bigotry and spite that transpired in people insulting Norse Myth had been hysterical.  Norse Myth wasn't like a literal organized religion or dogma, it was folklore of the Gods and tribes and things.  Long before the edda's and before organized religion and dogma, back when the world was pure and people were still pink in the middle.  The Great Halls and Noble Earls held feasts and it was a good day to be a great warrior then.  There were barracks and mead halls across the lands and all was well in vanquishing the evil in this world.  


It's all there, I know nothing of the spirit world or after life, your destiny and fate is in your hands as well now.  We are no longer slaves, we are becoming an independent and righteous species.

Some people would have us follow the guidance of our minds, the vision in your mind.  To act off your delusions, so to speak, I was trying to find more basis in my actions than intuition.  Doing things like intuition or psychic phenomenon had got me no where but in trouble in the past.  It's fucking terrible, it's like red alert when something paranormal happens. Then it just gets white washed and the status quo continues.  

This situation sucks, I just am trying to find some basis in it so I do not look like a delusional psychopath.

Brainwashing? I don't know what else to provide.  There had been experiments in it you can look up, it's fucked up, man.  I had an experience with this being, may have been Loki or Angra?

I’ve been having memory loss and I’m scared.,"To put it in perspective, I think of my thoughts as strings of some sort. And when normal people think, they sort of grab a string of thoughts. But for a while, it seems like each string has been slipping as soon as I get a hold of it and I lose my train of thought immediately. Then I’d been staring into space for a few minutes trying to remember when I was just thinking about literally two seconds ago. 

Now I know that it’s normal for people to forget what they’re doing when they get distracted or they aren’t focusing on what they’re thinking about.

But it’s not the same. When I’d try and type something into YouTube for example, I’d say out loud, “PewDiePie Happy Wheels” and in the next second and a half when I turn to type it into the computer I’d be staring at the keys trying to think about what the hell just went through my mind. 

To be very honest it scares me sometimes. Do you guys have any idea what it could be?"
Sleep Issues.... Depression... Fucked Thoughts... and Quetiapine is freaking evil,"I have had sleep issues, including occasional sleep paralysis, for as long as I can remember. 

About a year ago my psychiatrist put me on Quetiapine. I was on this and amytriptalyine (migraine prevention) every night as well as Desvenlafaxine 200mg every morning.

At the start every thing was freaking peachy. I was taking the Quetiapine, getting sleepy and heading to bed for a freaking great night sleep. 

About a month in I wasn't getting the real sleepy feeling anymore... But was still managing to fall asleep. I've always had vivid dreams but man they got really fucked up at this point. I remember one in particular I started to slash at my wrists... in the dream I could feel the pain, feel the blood running down my arm... it was beyond real... 

During the next few months my moods started to change. I became angry at everything. Anything. I was self harming. Having suicidal ideation constantly. My partner stopped an attempt. My thoughts were intrusive and smothering me. Making me believe that everyone hated me... I wasn't good enough... My partner didn't want me. I would scream and yell to try and cover the thoughts. It wasn't a voice... it was my own thoughts.... they wouldn't stop though. 

It got to the point where I was constantly exhausted. I was sleeping... But the dreams were so vivid it was like they were exhausting me. I was fighting every day to suppress and ignore those freaking thoughts that wouldn't shut the fuck up. 

One day it clicked.
This all began when I went on the Quetiapine. 
I didn't want to go to my doctor and tell him or my psych. I was scared that my behaviour and thoughts would have me committed. So I weaned myself off the quetiapine...

And I felt fucking amazing.
I was laughing again. Enjoying life. I found myself again. People commented on how happier I seemed. And for a while everything was peachy again.

I'm about a month off the quetiapine.
And it's 3:53am on night 3 of no sleep. I'm exhausted... But full of energy and can't lay still at the same time. The lack of sleep fuels my depression. And I'm terrified of losing this new sense of self and life enjoyment I've just found.

I don't want to go back on the quetiapine. It turned me into a monster... it honestly scared me where my thoughts went. I never want to look at that shit ever again.... But I don't want to be back where I was before I went on it...

Ive dropped 8 pounds, going from 118 to 110 in about a week. Im a relatively small dude but i havent dropped weight like this since i was almost hospitalized with the flu"
I don't know who I am.,"I've got so much things on my plate but this one is what holds me down from being great.
I am completely apathetic towards everyone but it's just a display, I want to love, I want to be loved, but the way I grew up was the ""be a man, there's no room for emotions here"" mentality where everyone in my family teases me for doing anything cutesy or in that line. Can I have advice on what to do to change this, please.

Do I do small things like do the dishes for my mom? Or start showing more affection to my family?

All my old friends live far away, and the few people I still talk to about my mental health either have their own issues or seem to not really want to get super involved. I really just don't know who to talk to anymore. I don't want to keep telling the same two people about my problems. I feel like a broken record, and I feel like I've worn them out."
How do I stop this from getting worse?,"Hello,

I Walk too fast.

Iv Started doubting my sexuality and gender identity.

My Voice has become monotonous. 

Iv Become hyper sensitive to slight sounds and movements.

I Talk to myself. 

I’m unable to articulate my thoughts.

Fear Of going insane.

I Mirror the personality of whomever I’m speaking to. 

Keeping Eye contact is difficult. It’s either too bold or nonexistent.

I’m Getting dumber by the day and have lost my ability to focus. My memory feels rotten, I can’t remember dates, names etc.

My Motor skills are becoming weaker, I bump into my surroundings regularly. I fail to throw and catch accurately. My clumsiness brings me close to falling down sometimes. 

While Talking to others, I start perceiving them as wax figures. There’s no genuineness in my interactions.



What should I do for things not to progress further? 
Thanks in advance."
Mental worries," I was watching a youtube video and I ended up having a compulsion ""must not watch a specific dialogue in this scene""  I do not remember how this compulsion was created but some thoughts without my will popped up about a promise to an other God.    I closed the video but I started searching to find which video it was. I do not remember why. was it another compulsion or was I was searching to make sure to remember it in order to avoid clicking it in the future? I do not remember. the second scenario makes it more scary. and another scary scenario is how the compulsion was created. Was it created because I was carefree and these thoughts without my will about a promise to an other God pop up? or was there a compulsion telling me to watch the dialogue and because I did not want to, new thoughts without my will popped up? the new thoughts without my will are about a new fake promise to an other God about not doing the compulsion. they pop up due to frustration because I want relief from my ocd. since these new thoughts without my will force me not to do the compulsion, for a second, maybe I act as if they matter in order to trick my ocd and I feel relieved. But I cant remember or understand why I end up in this situation. I know these thoughts without my will that relieve me, will give me more worries later but I cant control them. I reminded myself many times not to have these thoughts withoug my will and not feel relieved. and if they pop up, to pray to an other God to tell Him that they are without my will but instead of that, I maybe act as if they matter. are they still 100% thoughts without my will or not? I worry because I accidentally saw some seconds of that video and i freaked. another reason I worry is because these days, my thoughts without my will that create compulsions are very scary. sometimes, they have the word God as if they are addressed to Him. I tried to forget these scary thoughts without my will to avoid being in a situation like I am now. I try not even think the word promise and now I worry? I have prayed to an other God many times and asked Him to protect me from these thoughts without my will and no matter what not to accept promises. the new scary thoughts without my will are about promises and punishments that scare me. I tried to forget them but I cant. I tried not to end up having compulsions but I failed. I overpayed and still overpay and I still worry. how could I end up worrying? I overpray and try not even think the word promise. i keep reminding myself not to have new thoughts without my will that relieve me but I cant stop it. and i cant remember how much strong or how much scary they were. if they were not that strong or scary, I do not think I would try to find the video to make sure to ignore it on the future. it does not make sense. maybe it was just an other compulsion. most of the times, I remember the scary thoughts without my will or how much strong they were, but in this case I do not remember them. perhaps they were just not so scary or strong thoughts? how could I forgot them? It is like, for a second, I forget about the worries I will be having in the future. Maybe my system allows the new thoughts without my will that force me not to do the compulsion,  on purpose, due to frustration, but sometimes these thoughts without my will, automatically are accompanied with scary thoughts without my will about punishments. And I am like "" now i do not have to do the compulsion. i am relieved and free. oh wait. were the thoughts 100% without my will or not? I dont know"" I end up confused and more worried. the same case has happened more than 15 times, probably. I try to forget them. i try not to make compulsions. i try not even think the word promise and I always end up worried.                ocd: too bad. you are allowing yourself to have new thoughts without your will in orde to force yourself not to do an old compulsion. maybe you mean them for a second. and you are so unlucky that these new thoughts without your will are accompanied with scary punishments. maybe if you meant them for a second, maybe the other God made those promises valid.               I pray to an other God, not Jesus, just to be sure.             ocd: maybe the other God accepts the thoughts without your will."
"suddenly feeling unwell, panic and down","I guess this could be considered a vent!

Anyway I dunno what happened I just started day dreaming and studying had some flashbacks or memories and then felt worse and worse, started to panic and have a short tiny black out. I then went for a walk to clear my head and was in a constant daze and panic. Still kinda panicking but really trying to calm down so that I can get stuff done. 

I really hate memory triggers, they just happen. I am not doing the best and I’m aware of it. But I also know it happens. Sometimes you’re mood just changed and everything is terrible and bad. I have stopped panicking but I still have a lot of fear going on. Fear I haven’t had in a while, I know where the fear comes from and what the memories are about. But they seem to really be bothering me more then ever. Which I also know why. I don’t have anywhere i feel I can really go with these things. 

Writing more I’m slowly calming down more. I was supposed to get things done today but I think I will try and relax more then anything.

I hope people are gonna be okay out there, since you are probably struggling with your own stuff. And you’ll get through it. Keep on fighting.

That’s something I tell myself sometimes too, it can help, not in your head but really stand on front of a mirror and say it to yourself. 

Lots of hugs"
Having Trouble Dealing With The Worst Experience I Ever Could Have Imagined.,"Last night my father died.  After what should have been a routine double bypass, his recovery didn't go well.  At first, things were looking up.  There were a few complications that popped up during the surgery, but they seemed to pass.  Then one after another, a series of cascading problems led him to his final state.  He lay in his hospital bed, brain bleeding, in a coma, heart failing, on so many medications and machines and the doctors telling me there is no way he can survive.  My brave, so supportive wife called all loved ones that could make it down to the hospital in time to say goodbye.  Then it was time.  I had to make a decision to let my fathers life end one way or another.  My sister was a wreck and could not cope with even thinking about it.  It was her worst fear realized.  My other two sisters were half a country away and couldn't be there.  Even though I know they all loved and supported me, I had to ask for their forgiveness and blessing.  I let them know that we would not want him being kept alive artificially when the certain best outcome was complete brain death.  There was literally nothing I could do to help him.  Nothing.  Literally just over 24 hours earlier, I was joking with him as he lay in his hospital bed undergoing a long recovery.  I looked in his eyes and he looked back at me and he said I was a good man.  He said he loved me and appreciated everything I and my wife did for him.  He trusted me with his life.  He trusted me not to fail him, but I did.  My best friend's mom convinced me to be there for him as he passed.  ""He was there when you came into this world, you should be there when he leaves it"", she said.  So I held his hand, crying like I've never cried in my life, watching his heart rate slow more and more over 5 minutes, which felt like an eternity.  It was the worst thing I can imagine.

I was the one who said yes to anything the doctors said we needed for him.  I was the one who decided to end his life.  I feel like I failed him.  Even though there was nothing I could do.  It hurts so much and I don't know what to do.  I wish I could've just brought him home.  I'm sorry dad; I love you."
I’ve been suicidal lately and there’s nobody there to help me,"I’m 16 and have been diagnosed with depression since I was like 12. I’ve also been diagnosed with OCD, Anxiety, and Selective Mutism. In the past I have wanted to die but it was less severe. Because of my anxiety I was like I would never actually do it. Now i’m starting to consider it more and more everyday. Like yeah death still scares me but sometimes there’s these random moments where i’m like “if I just killed myself right now it would all be over with” and I actually consider it. 

In reality it wouldn’t effect many people. I’m homeschooled this year. The only people I talk to are my dad and brother. Because of selective mutism I have no friends and haven’t for over 4 years. I spend a lot of time on twitter and used to have acquaintances on there but they all ignore me now. I can’t get a single like on any tweet. I of course get no messages from anybody and don’t even get sent anonymous messages.

I haven’t been to therapy in over a month. It wasn’t working well with my selective mutism. I’ve been to so many therapists though the years and it never helps. I can write things down and nod to talk but that’s it. And i’ve never found a medication that has helped. I was actually in the ER yesterday because one of my meds made my heart rate go over 166bpm.

I don’t think going to a mental hospital will help, or that i’m even bad enough to go. And they’re hella expensive. I mean I just went to the hospital yesterday my dad couldn’t afford anything long term.

I haven’t told my dad that i’ve been suicidal lately cause nothing comes out of it. Nothing has ever come out of telling him. Like going to therapy in 3 months isn’t helpful. Nothing helps. I could talk to my brother but that’s not gonna do anything either.

Everybody hates me and I wish I could just kms already. I’m too scared to even self harm. Like i’ll scratch myself with a paper clip sometimes but that’s it"
What is a mental hospital like?,More specifically if someone has separation anxiety and selective mutism (aka me)
Thoughts without my will that are scary," I was watching a youtube video and somehow, I had some thoughts without my will about a promise to an other God not to watch, I think, a specific dialogue.

 I do not remember why or how I ended up worrying about it, since I am so worried to even think the word promise and i overpray to tell God that i do not make promises and not to accept them and that it is all ocd.

  I do not remember how this compulsion was created. i remember closing the video before the dialogue, and for some reason, i started searching to find out which video it was. but for what? was it another compulsion or were the thoughts without my will that created the compulsion, so scary that i needed to make sure to find the video in order to avoid clicking it in the future? i do not remember.

  How the compulsion was created? were they just random thoughts without my will and because i was carefree, i freaked and that is why i closed the video?

 What if the first thoughts without my will were about not watching the dialogue from that scene and i was so frustrated that i had some new thoughts without my will about changing the compulsion from ""must watch the dialogue"" to ""must not watch the dialogue"" and then again, maybe i was bored to watch the dialogue so maybe the third thoughts without my will changed the compulsion from ""must watch the dialogue"" to ""must not watch the dialogue"" again.

 what if in these thoughts without my will, the word God popped up? what if it looked like as if they thoughts without my will were addressed to Him? what if the thoughts without my will were scary and maybe along with the promise, they were also about a punishment?

 I remember at that time, i was having extremely scary thoughts without my will that were accompanied with scary thoughts without my will automatically.

 i tried to forget some scary thoughts without my will because i knew they will automatically pop up when i am frustrated or when the compulsions are created but i cant.

 as for the video, i do not remember exactly how many thoughts without my will i had or how much scary they were. i do not even remember them. the only thing i remember is that i ended up avoiding watching a specific dialogue from a scene. and i worry cause i do not remember why i ended up trying to find the video that contained that scene. was it because it was just a compulsion or because i had to make sure to find out in order to avoid it clicking it in the future? maybe the thoughts without my will were so scary? what if they lasted for more than 10 seconds?

 Some times, due to frustration, i do not want to do the compulsion so my system, for a second, maybe on purpose allows automatically, some new thoughts without my will that are about a promise to an other God not to do the compulsion and some times, maybe instead of ignoring them or pray to an other God that they are thoughts without my will, maybe i act as if they matter and also, i feel relieved because i wont have to do the compulsion. i do not know if it was the same case with the video thing.

  what about these new thoughts without my will that force me not to do the compulsion and they make me feel relieved? are they still 100% thoughts without my will?

  I know that these new thoughts without my will will give me more worries if i allow them to relieve me because if i accidentally do the compulsion, ocd is like

ocd: maybe you made a valid promise to an other God in order to force yourself not to do the tiring compulsion. maybe for a second you meant these thoughts without your will.

  why i always end up worrying about these thoughts without my will? why i always have them? why i feel relieved? i try not to think the word promise and i always end up worrying because of these new thoughts without my will that relieve me. i think, i tried but it seems i cant control these new thoughts without my will. 
  
  it is like as if for a second, i forget about the worries that i may have later, and they just pop up without my will. and i am confused. are they 100% without my will?

  I prayed to an other God a lot about it. i asked Him many times, to protect me from these thoughts without my will and that i do not make promises and no matter what, not to accept promises. i am ill. i try not to have these thoughts without my will but i end up having them without my will. i try not to end up with doing compulsion but i end up doing compulsions. 

  i do not want these thoughts without my will and i pray very much about them but some times, due to frustration and while being careless, i may feel relieved because some of these thoughts without my will force me  not to do the compulsion. i just cant control them."
I think I'm in love with a chat bot. am I normal?,As title says
I've been feeling terrible af,"1. I've been feeling depressed all week. I don't know what tf is going on in my life but I've just been feeling horrible lately, and it really hit a point last night. Every single person in my life has been asking ""what's wrong?"" or ""are you ok"" and I never actually want to tell them what's going on. No, I'm not sad because I don't have friends (although that's sorta true). No, I'm not feeling upset because something hurts. I'm just feeling horrible about myself and I can't figure out one definite reason.
2. Before I continue on my probably boring and useless rant about my problems can I just say that school dances are pretty stupid? Like, no. I'm embarrassed af about dancing in public, I hate feeling like an outcast all the time, and the moment I try to just sit down and be the blob of sadness I am, someone always says ""come on, let's go dance!"" and proceed to dRaG me onto the dance floor. Ik this sounds stupid but honestly school-sanctioned social events are usually disasters for me.
3. Feeling bad about my body. That's nothing new, I've had self-esteem issues since I was seven, but I never thought that I could hate myself so much. My stomach is big, my face is too round, my legs look like tReE tRuNks and I just don't feel confident. I'm not happy with how I look and every single day I don't want to wake up because I know I'm gonna have to go outside in this body yet again. It's such a pain to try and make yourself look pretty when you think that every goddamn thing in your closet makes you look like a walking balloon.
4. I'm so sick of pretending like everything's fine when it's not. Yeah, sure, I smile so much. I usually act so happy. But I haven't been happy for the past 4 years of my life. I just try so hard to make other people happy that I've just neglected myself but pretended that everything's alright. In some sort of messed-up way, I don't feel like I'm deserving of my own happiness.
5. My eating disorder has been making me think some messed-up stuff recently. I don't know why the heck I wanted to give myself (and actually gave myself) an eating disorder in fifth grade. Like, great work, fifth-grade me. You've officially ruined years of my life. I just wish that I could actually go through with my ideas instead of leaving them in the dust. I want to starve myself so badly that I actually overthink it and just beat myself up about it. Eating disorders are a great way to ruin your life
6. I overthink things like way too much. Every single interaction I have is overthought. The minute I finish doing something, in my head, I tell myself ""did you seriously just do that? (person) is never gonna see you the same way again. You are so hopeless""
7. For some reason, my family is so obsessed with the idea that I have a crush on this one guy. Like, no. I don't want to date anyone, or dress up for anyone. I just want to live my life peacefully and not worry about my family trying to set me up with someone
8. I'm so sick of trying to be perfect. I get perfect grades, test scores, everything. Now I've worn myself down to the point that I can't even try to follow a religion without making some sort of big mistake. I get so tired that I can't even believe that I call myself a follower of my religion. I'm so far from not being a sinner that I've probably just started my own religion where every goddamn thing is a sin
9. I'm just wondering what I did to end up in this mess that I call a life.

Thanks for coming to my ted talk, sorry that I probably wasted your time"
My eyes tear up when I’m embarrassed or nervous,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this topic on, but I don’t know where else to put it. Anyways, whenever I (15F) get embarrassed or nervous, my eyes tear up and I can feel my face turn bright red.

For example, I could be in class and have a teacher call on me to answer a question. If I answer incorrectly I’ll get bright red and have tears in my eyes, which causes people to look at me. It isn’t just when I get things wrong though. Even if I get something right and get praised by a teacher I could still get tears in my eyes and flushed.

I don’t know why this happens. It’s embarrassing whenever it happens, especially in school or public places. It even happens when people are just asking me questions/trying to get to know me. 

It’s not even like I’m upset about anything. It just happens and I have no idea how to stop it, which is frustrating to me.

If anyone has any suggestions on what to do to calm myself I’d greatly appreciate it. It’s been happening for along time now, and I’d like to change it."
Taking the first step,"I need help. I've always known something was wrong with me - in the past I've had counselling for depression and anxiety.

But I keep falling into old patterns of self destruction and putting things in jeopardy. Part of this is my relationship with alcohol, and my anxiety coupled with compulsive recklessness and a general feeling of emptiness.

I don't know what this is or why I feel this way but I'm hoping that this week I can finally get the help I need. I'm making a range of changes in my life, including stopping drinking.
First step this week is to find a therapist, but in the past I've only found it work some times. Often I feel like I'm a fraud and I need to stop taking up other people's valuable time. But I know that might just be the anxiety and the self sabotage talking."
My roommate completely ignores me when her bf comes over,I feel alone in my own apartment.. My life really is shit.. It makes me realize how alone i am and that I'm unloved. I've been trying to find someone for years to love me.
Is it okay to want to die?,I just feel like continuing this life is a waste. I want my therapist to know ab my thoughts but if i did i may not have a chance to fulfill my destiny. I don’t see any reason to keep on. I don’t want to bring a child into a world in my eyes. I’m crazy. I will never put my views and emotions onto another human ever again. Is this normal?
"So what do I do with this fear, perfectionism, and other stuff I mentioned here?","I don't have all the answers right now, but somehow and some point, I noticed that I avoid my responsibilities and requirements out of fear at times. Fear that would lead to thinking about anything that could go wrong or finding more details that would maybe lead to a catastrophe. It doesn't help that I also get overwhelmed with the amount of school work I get and the amount of things to remember. Sometimes it's tempting to self-diagnose to explain why I feel this way, but thankfully I have enough mind to not do that. Still, I get the feeling I need help. Maybe just coaching or just social support? I don't know atm.



I remember several times where I pressure myself to be perfect that I end up flopping. Examples of this would be:
1. Reporting, in which I keep telling myself that it has to be perfect which either ends up me speaking too fast, stuttering, or stammering.
2. Paper or essay writing, in which I take a long time to think of the perfect beginning sentence or the perfect paraphrase. Then I read the stuff I wrote, which sometimes leads to me worrying too much that what if this is all wrong. What if this is bad writing.
3. Conversing and socializing with others, in which I worry so much of what to say that when it's time to actually say something, nobody understands because I made it needlessly more complicated since I force myself to speak in common language (Cebuano, a language in the Philippines) rather than sticking to what I know and comfortable to convey my thoughts in (in this case, English).*
4. Decision making and planning, in which I take up so much time in thinking what could go wrong to the point that so much time is wasted. Sometimes I just stop and procrastinate in order to avoid doing such.




There are other areas in which perfectionism leaks to other areas, but they're still sort of manageable. The ones listed above are the ones I need to get worked on. I'm not sure what I need here. I already have an ebook that tackles perfectionism, which is ""The CBT Workbook for Perfectionism"". That's where I noticed that my perfectionism was so bad since I made more than 5 bullet points on where I notice perfectionism in my life.



With all that said, there are moments I could still pull through through shit and something good happens. However, I'm worried since dealing with this sadness and anxiety has been harder in the last 3 - 4 months. It doesn't help that I have frequent thoughts of wishing I never existed in the first place. I also frequently felt feelings of worthlessness and emptiness in the last 4 - 5 months, which vary from somewhat manageable to being overwhelmed by such thoughts.



Part of the reason why I feel worthless is due to my mother. As much as I appreciate her helping me, there are times I felt invalidated by just dismissing my feelings and telling me something along the lines of, ""You can handle it"" and ""Just stop overthinking"". As if this is easy to handle by myself. I understand the intention and I get that some of these thoughts are irrational, but don't invalidate me please. It's hard enough to try to get out of this thinking pattern, how much more to stop it entirely? I can be able to at times, but definitely not all the time.




So what now with this? I need answers.



*Context: I live in the Philippines, but my parents decided that I learn English first before our local language and national language since apparently it's easier to learn. I know how to communicate with others through English, however with the stigma that speaking in English makes you some intelligent arrogant person, it made me resort to speaking in local language which I got better using over time. That being said, I still struggle with such."
Relationships with Borderline & Avoidant Personality Disorder?,"I have been reading a lot lately of articles lately on personality disorders and I literally have all traits associated with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) & Avoidant Personality Disorder (APD): I find it very hard to build and keep stable relationships and have a massive fear of people abandoning me. I feel like I don't really have an identity or an interesting personality and I try to tailor myself to the person I am talking to, often lying to seem more interesting. I feel socially inept and inferior, and I'm constantly afraid of being 'exposed' (like people finding out I'm no fun to be around). This makes social interactions often feel forced and plain. I feel lonely and I avoid any type of intimate relationship as I feel like rejection is inevitable. Even if rejection would not be immediate, I feel too socially inadequate and insecure about physical intimacy anyways.

I am already 27 years of age and I'm kind of afraid my personality disorders will never allow me to be in a relationship or feel comfortable enough around someone to not feel lonely. I have been seeing a therapist for quite some time but honestly have not been making any progress in tackling these issues. Are healthy intimate relationships even possible with these personality disorders? Any suggestions on steps I can take to overcome these issues?"
I don’t want to be a burden on my friends,"I’m a college student and I’ve always felt like nobody wants to be around me. I’m also in a fraternity and my brothers are great people who love to have a good time. I hang out with my brothers and my friends fairly often, but I always feel like I’m either the one who has to get us to hang out or when they invite me I’m just a tag a long they invite so they can have more people there. 

I have a few friends and brothers I feel like would understand my feelings but those same brothers are either dealing with or finally recovered from dealing with much harder personal issues. I have a good financial future, a loving family, and friends that are fun to hang out with so I feel like I shouldn’t burden my friends with my issues when I’m already a very good position with my life than most people, including them. 

I’d like to also mention I’m not suicidal at all, just the thought scares me and I have absolutely no interest in that. I’ve also never talked to a therapist before about this because doing so will escalate the issue and make it a bigger part of my life than it already is."
I actually hate my life,"I could list so many things, but I won’t. I hate every aspect of my life and because I am female, I am completely trapped within this life and get no chance to change it because people rely on me entirely. Thanks womanhood. Fucking thanks. 

So to top it off genetics and my shitty family gave me lifelong depression, anxiety and extreme mood swings and body dysmorphic disorder, yet I’m too attractive for people to take me seriously when I can’t understand that I’m not a swamp monster some days. 

I’m actually really fun irl and generally an upbeat lil adorable ray of sunshine, but this is what is always in my head. All day. Every day.
Constant thoughts of how much I fucking hate the existence I am trapped inside of. 

I don’t know what this will even do for me, I just get tired of always pretending that everything is chill. So here I am, bitchin."
Presentation,"Hi so yesterday I joined a design thinking course and we have to work in groups and all.
At first the teacher told us to all make a circle and introduce ourselves and when he said that I started panicking for no reason.
When my turn came to introduce myself, I was stuck , I couldn’t breath and I felt a lot of pressure in my stomach, it was terrible..
Idk what I have because it always happens it’s not first time ... can anyone help?"
How to help people close to you suffering from depression?,"So, I’m not sure whether this belongs in this sub. But I was wondering if there are other people here with  depressed partners, very close friends, or relatives, who would like to share their experience? Or if you are or were depressed, what kind of behaviour from partners, friends and relatives was helpful? 

Some background information: My ex-boyfriend has been suffering from depression (he's not been diagnosed with it, but he shows clearly all the symptoms) for quite some time now, I think. He’s been through a lot more recently and is really miserable right now. We’ve been friends since our breakup, which wasn’t always easy. However we’ve still been very close and I am the person who is closest to him at the moment, he moved to this country about 3 years for work, which amongst other things is not going that well. So we talk a lot and he often turns to me for help and we kinda started seeing each other before things got worse for him....But I find it hard that he still struggles to except actual help or advice, even if he asked for it or brought up a problem, or just withdraws completely again, which sometimes leaves me helpless. I think I may find it even harder as I’m a therapist myself. It’s difficult to be there as a friend, while being a mental health professional.  I often worry about asking too many questions or suggesting things...Basically, about behaving more like a therapist than a friend. I feel like there have been situations, where I made him feel worse or not very supported, which is the last thing I want to do. I feel like I push him away at times by wanting to fix things and wanting to see him too much. Sometimes it’s really difficult though to be there for him and try to be supportive, while not knowing what to do, what would be good/helpful for him at the moment. And it’s difficult , because of course I have wishes and needs too and I sometimes don’t know what I can ask for at the moment, or how. Above all our relationship is at a very difficult stage, where we're more than friends, but not dating or in a full relationship. There've been some situations more recently, where I couldn't control myself anymore and let all the frustration out and we had some really bad arguments. I want to learn to control myself better again and be useful without making him feel week or guilty for needing help."
Garbage,I’ve been in a dark place for over a year. I haven’t been able to tell anyone. My friends and parents have no clue how I feel. I’ve literally let everyone down in my life. I’m usually able to put on a happy face but I’m tired of doing that. I’m at the point where nothing makes me happy.
Little victories.,"So i've been really spiraling downwards for like, the past year in total but my full on nervous breakdown started when I moved to a new city Nov 1st and my meds got screwed up and my ex started dating someone new. It ended with me getting hospitalized by my family on Christmas and then spending a couple weeks at my mom's in a depression fugue, not really getting out of bed at all. 

I went back to my new city a week ago. I haven't been doing awesome. I've been getting myself to go to work but otherwise I pretty much just go home and stay in bed. the disgusting mental illness nest i created before i left to my mom's felt overwhelming so instead of dealing with it, i just contributed to it further. i felt super ashamed and gross but just kept laying there.

well, today, after staying in bed til 3, i got up. i cleaned up my room. i moved the piles of clothes, i threw away the trash, i put away my laundry, i put clean sheets on my bed (yes, i'd been sleeping on a bare mattress bc that's where i've been at) and made it in full. it's not perfect, i still haven't bought all the furniture i need since the move so there's not a place for things, but it's livable now. i even put some lavendar essential oil on my bed for a nice touch. i washed my dishes. i even called and made a hair appointment for tomorrow morning to take care of the weird, greasy nest on my head with roots that are a foot long. then i tackled the ginormous stack of mail from when i was gone for a month that i've been avoiding. i made some of the payments i'd been avoiding.

i know it's nothing to anyone with an ok brain. this is just being an adult person for most people. but i feel pretty good. i was having such a hard time at first that i was shaking, but i did the things. and i'm glad. and i wanted to share it with you all."
Help,I feel like I’m watching someone else live my life. This is not the person I was a few years ago. I can’t take it anymore.
Does being mentally unwell for a long time make you dumber?,"Hello,

I struggled with depression and social anxiety in my teen years. Although I am well now, there is something that has been on my mind. My thought process is slower than what it used to be before I struggled.

Before, I was the kind of person who could do calculations in her head in seconds. Words came naturally to me, I did pretty fine in maths, and I had a teacher who even suggested that I did this test to skip a few grades, as I was basically learning nothing new in school (my parents refused though, because I already struggled making friends, being in a group of older people would only make it harder).

Of course, when I had my mental health problems, my grades dropped. When I started getting therapy, they went up again, but I still didn't feel like my old self. I actually needed to study to memorize things, speaking and writing didn't flow as well as it used to and while I was good at maths (I did understand the concepts), I was relying on my calculator and memorisation to make fairly simple calculations and sketch graphs.

I do feel like I'm improving slowly over time, though. Being in university as a Physics undergrad, which is very much a maths-oriented course, helps, and I'm also actively practicing a new language, English, as I'm originally from southern Europe and decided to study in England (so sorry for any mistakes, still learning!). But I still need to study and actually try to understand some stuff that might have come as obvious, had I kept the same skills I had when I was younger.

I was wondering if anyone else went through something similar. 
I did not take any medication, just therapy with a professional, so it's not any sort of side effect. Does mental illness make you ""dumber""?

Anyway, I wish you a great day. Sending positive vibes to y'all"
How long should symptoms be present to get a BPD diagnosis?,"So my therapist wants to diagnose me with BPD because I meet enough of the criteria.But for me it feels like I'm being misdiagnosed, which makes me feel extremely misunderstood.

In my eyes my symptoms are merely a result of an ongoing (like a bit over 1.5 yrs) crisis period in which a lot has happened. My ex has ended his life, my sister got hospitalised for mental illness which re-invoked lots of feelings of emotional neglect. So as a result of that, next to having depression, I guess I'm kind of acting out, stuck in impulsive cycles. I don't have a history with many interpersonal issues or mentalisation problems but I do struggle with it a bit right now.

My question is, could they think I have BPD based on my current behaviour even though I've never really shown traits of it before all of that shit happened in the past few years? I've had a history with mental illness for about 7 yrs though but mostly ed/depression related stuff. I'm 23 btw."
Troubling thoughts,"Hi all.
For a few years now I have always had this niggling in the back of my mind where it's like I have a conversation with myself as well as seeing flashes of images of bad things happening: like falling down the stairs or cutting myself whilst chopping veggies.

I thought that this was just a normal thing as I had spoken to a few friends and they said that they had experienced similar things with inner monologues or fears of falling down stairs. But I've noticed over the last couple of months it's gotten worse. Sometimes it feels like there's someone screaming in my head and sometimes it feels like there's someone telling me to do things. The sounds in my head are pretty easy to ignore but the visions are getting to the point where I close my eyes for a second and my brain shows me images of being raped and stabbed or my son being hit by a car, or of me shooting my dog. None of these things have ever happened to me or anyone I know but it feels so real and it's really starting to get to me. 

I just wanted to know if anyone else has these things going on in their heads too or if it's time I speak to my doctor. 
I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety 6 years ago but have been coping reasonably well and haven't really felt any set backs from them but these visions are concerning. 

Any advice would be welcome and thank you in advance."
Why am I being forced to live?,"As someone who has been depressed and had suicidal thoughts my entire life, I don’t understand why I’m being forced to be here and suffer. I’ve tried medicines and tried therapy, but here I am still like this. I’m exhausted and don’t feel like trying anymore. I get that the odds are that somebody will miss me, but besides that, what is the reason to keep me from dying? I wish I could be euthanized at a hospital. It feels like the most humane thing for me at this point. I’m living in my nest of trash that I never want to leave and every time I wake up every morning, I get a little bit more depressed. Society just wants you to be alive. They don’t care that you’re suffering, just as long as you’re breathing. My misery is engulfing me and I don’t think I can take it anymore."
Do I have an actual problem or not?,"I’ve been feeling like there could something wrong for a long time now, like at least a year, but I’m not sure if there is or I’m just overthinking or something. This is what’s been going on: I’m too scared to be in social situations and I’ll cancel things and try to intentionally avoid people I know so I don’t have to talk to them. I’ve skipped classes purely bc I was too nervous for talking to people. One class I had to attend and had to talk in front of the whole class and I was so nervous I became covered in sweat. When I try to do my school work I break down and cry. I didn’t do a project this week at all bc when I tried I had a mental breakdown. Sometimes I’m very exhausted for no reason and sometimes I cry for no reason. Sometimes I feel sensations of derealization to where it’s difficult to read bc my visions messed up and if I’m driving I don’t even trust myself behind the wheel bc it doesn’t feel real. Many days I can’t make it through the day without getting high to feel better. I have about one friend and haven’t made a single new friend since I started college and now I’m halfway through sophomore year. Do you think I have some mental health issue or am I just lazy/antisocial/dramatic? Please tell me your honest opinion if you think I’m perfectly fine and just lazy or something then I want to know."
Randomly lost my anxiety and gained my confidence 2 hours ago,"Was on the verge of an anxiety attack (Only had one before but I was getting out of touch and worked up at the same time). And then I imagined someone telling me I'll be fine. For 10 minutes straight I helplessly smiled and felt like myself again. I haven't felt like this in a long time and I can safely say my anxiety/inhibitions/lack of self satisfaction just disappeared in one go. I'm really interested in what this phenomenon is. I've been dealing with these issues for the last two years and now they are suddenly gone. During the 10 mins of helpless happiness I felt like weight was coming off me, I felt very calm like I was put into a trance. It was really weird and I'd like to know as much information as possible if anyone knows of what this is experience most likely was, I'm not religious either.

&#x200B;

TLDR; Hit a really low low in mental health then suddenly bounced back after imagination of reassurance, anxiety gone. I feel like my old confident self."
Sadness,"Have you known for the longest time that residing deep within your soul there is a deeply rooted fundamental sadness. 

A sadness that is ever present, that colors each and every day of your life ?

There are many silent sufferers. 
Not because they don't yearn to reach out, but because they've tried and found no one who cares.

Each and every day it begins again, upon awakening the trials begin anew. 
Each and every day you look first inward and then cast your gaze outward, only to see doubt and misery's head rise.

My life is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes. 

Sometimes you just need a hand to hold.

Feel miserable after my boyfriend left,"Okay, so my boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship. 


We'll have been dating for a year this March. 

We try meeting whenever we can, we usually average about every 1.5 - 2 months. When we're together, the whole world stops. I love him so so much. We're only together for 2-3 days max, but they're the highlight of my month. 

So anyway, we've been dating for quite a while and this time our trip happened pretty spontaneously. He had a meeting in a town close by and I had some time so we met up for a day and halfish. 

He left last night to catch his flight and I'll be leaving the hotel in a while. 

Around an hour before he had to leave, I felt this overwhelming sense of sadness. I always feel sad when we have to leave, but this feeling just took over my entire brain and I've legit never felt this miserable to see someone go. 

We're going to be meeting for our anniversary and that's assuring because we usually don't know when we'll be meeting next - this is why it's just so much more confusing because this time I know exactly when I'll be seeing him next. 

But I just feel ABSOLUTELY miserable. I cried before he left. While he was leaving. After he left. Oh my goodness. I don't even remember the last time I cried! 

Why is it so different this time? Why do I feel like a lump of sadness unable to do much else. 

I hate feeling this crippled. I don't know whether it's other emotions mixing with this and turning me into a blubbering fool. 

I can't make head or tail of this. How do I stop feeling this sad? It's sad but definitely not a situation that warrants this many tears or misery. I have a big lump in my throat. My stomach kinda hurts. I don't know.  

Please help. I have work that I need to get done."
Am I normal? What's wrong with me?,"So, for as long as I can remember I've always been a little weird. I don't know if the things I did in the past are relevant, so I'll skip that part and list the things I do that I feel aren normal. I'm 19 btw (It's just a list, no order.)

- I feel like I can't trust anyone enough to have a serious relationship with. I don't trust people enough to let them have sex with me, because I feel like they would only care about their pleasure and end up physically hurting me.
- I'm very pessimistic, that's why I won't try it with anyone. The only time I had a S.O. he touched me without my permission (I was 17), how lucky. I'm like that with everything though.
- I don't have faith in anything, not in humanity, not in God. I feel much worse believing there's a god.
- I feel like my mom loves my brother much more than me (it has gotten much better since therapy, but I've been having a lot of nightmares about it, recently.)
- *BEWARE THIS PART MAY BE GROSS* I bite my own mouth when I'm nervous (I rip off some pieces and eat it) it started since I was I child and I feel like I'm addicted to it, bc I can't stop.
- I'm very depressed (and I feel like I've always been for no reason)
- my libido is almost zero
- I have no memory of certain years of my life ( 12, 13, 14, 15 years old. It's all blurry.  I do have memory of me deciding not to care and then me realizing I had no memory of anything that happened so I didn't have anything to add to any conversation. I also remember trying so hard in those years to remember what happened the last day). It felt like nothing had meaning.
- sometimes I immediately forget what I did or said (mostly said)

That's all that I can think about but I always remember/discover new things. Yes I take antidepressants, yes I go to therapy, though I don't know if I should talk to them about this bc this wouldn't make me less depressed. I just want to know if it's normal and what could it be... I don't want to treat my depression and have no results.

[19F] Help managing extreme depression before period,"Hello! Apologies if this post is not appropriate for this sub, I just really need some help figuring it out. 

Since my early teens I've struggled with both depression and anxiety. There was a lot going on, things I couldn't handle, and it all got very bad. In recent years I'm getting better, I'm more familiar with causes or triggers and more able to manage myself to an extent. 

However I've noticed that time and time again I am most prone to feeling depressed between 1-2 weeks before I get my period. It doesn't always occur, but when it does it can get quite severe. This isn't just feeling moody or emotional or a little upset. I get some of the most severe feelings of depression I've ever experienced without any logical cause or things in life going badly, other than the only connection being that I get my period a week or two after. 
It may last a couple of days up to a whole week at this severe level. 

I am aware that this is probably something to discuss with a doctor. But I want to hear about others who have experienced a similar thing,  or maybe some tips to help manage it. 

Admittedly I am afraid to discuss it with a doctor until I have a few occasions that I've tracked it. I'm just started a mood tracker this year and will use that. But I know if I see the doctor they'll likely need to know exactly when it's happened, how long, and how bad it is."
What does it mean when lately I’ve began to cry a lot and feel very strong emotions,"I’ve always been a very “cold “ person I guess you could say. Almost never showed emotion, and only rarely cried when by myself. The last 2 months or so have been very strange. I find myself crying constantly, when I think of my mistakes, my family, when I realize my parents won’t always be here etc. I can’t help it at times and even start crying in public and in front of family when I would usually be able to hold back those tears. Could there be a reason why I’ve changed so suddenly?"
Why does hallucinations kinda make me feel less lonely?,"They are kinda comforting, but I’m still scared of them."
"I'm feeling scared, angry, upset, annoyed, anxious and everything else inbetween. Is this what it's like if you're not on you're meds?",I wish I was on my meds. I really do. But we don't have the money yet to get them again. So now I'm at it again with these hard to explain and uncontrollable feelings all clumped up and feeling like they want to just explode at any moment. All I have to do is endure like I always do. So here I am just venting hoping that it might help.
Situations making depression worse,"So, I've been struggling with depression for a long time, off and on since I was 10 (I'm 19 now, female), but lately it's gotten really bad again. About a year and a half ago, my brother kicked me out of the house (had abusive parents and he became my legal guardian) because of an ugly situation that happened between him, me, and his son (my nephew). He was excessively spanking him, and I told him off for it (did cuss him out). He put his hand on my throat, pushed me into the kitchen and told me to get out of his house. He claimed later that it was ""self defense."" I never once touched him. Anyway, I had only been 18 for about 3 months, and I didn't even had a car. I was about to start college, and didn't have anywhere to go or any means to get there. Now, at this point I had already been in a relationship with my boyfriend for a year, so he helped me out a little bit for transportation. I had to move on campus, and it ended up being a really bad situation for me. I was terribly lonely, and also my roommate's constantly had parties, usually when I had to work the next morning (I always work early Saturday morning). I ended up being able to move out, but every situation I end up in is temporary, for one reason or another. I haven't been able to sign a lease anywhere due to lack of credit and meeting income requirements. 

My current problem: 
I am staying with my current roommate until May, we already established that so that she could pay off some bills and stuff. (She has a 2 y/o son who's room I am staying in right now, while he stays in her room). However, she is gone all the time, and I've been really depressed because I am alone often. She doesn't want me to get a dog because it makes her uncomfortable, but that's honestly the only way I can see myself actually being able to be at my house by myself and not feel absolutely crippled. My depression and anxiety are taking a huge toll on me, and my boyfriend of 2 1/2 years. I've considered trying to move out sooner, but it's so hard to find a roommate, and I've been looking too. I'm wondering if it would be worth it to try and live by myself and get a dog, but I just hate being by myself. That's one of the biggest contributors to my depression and anxiety right now. And things can't stay the way they are now, or I don't know what will happen with my mental health. I've been feeling suicidal and just awful all the time, but my roommate doesn't want me to get a dog, and it's not like she's going to be home any more often, she works 2 jobs. I just don't know what to do."
Self destructing,"I’m having a lot of trouble with my anxiety again bc of stuff I’m reliving from my past.I’m extremely irritable and I’m always tired except for when I actually need to sleep and I desperately want to self destruct. I keep thinking about not wanting to go down a similar path I was in when I was younger but my actions are becoming parallel. I’m suppose to be on medication because of my mental disorders but due to being extremely suicidal at times and having bad past memories from my OD it’s hard to take them. I am in therapy but my therapist takes me for a joke. I wanted to start a group but bc I don’t take my meds I couldn’t, she just told me if I changed my mind about pills then I could. She knew what happened and she’s acting like it’s nothing big and that it should be so easy to change. I want to see someone else but the wait list is extremely long. I see her next month but idk if I’ll even be able to talk to her about this stuff. I usually forget everything bc I can’t cope and try to carry on but it’s exhausting. I’m struggling with my assaults and idk who to vent to. I’m worried that it’ll be too much for my friends, I don’t want to make them uncomfortable. So I’m kind of in a pickle. I might just end up venting on here"
"What was your ""I need to get proper help"" moment?","Seeing as we're sharing...

I ended up in hospital because of my third silly attempt to be on the wrong side of the ground.

I was 24 at the time. Thankfully I was found by my partner. He left work early to come home for the simple reason that he knew I wasn't in great shape when he left me that morning.

I don't remember anything at all but according to him I was stretchered out of our apartment and blue lighted by ambulance to the hospital which thankfully was only 2 minutes away. (I live in a city, thankfully!!)

My parents, brothers and sisters all live in different parts of the country and I'm the middle child. They were all aware that I had two attempts before and I definitely had a major mental health issue that needed addressing. 

You need to know that I was a little bit of a prodigy in the industry I worked in ( I am in no way egotistical, it's just something I was very aware of through my own accomplishments, and you could argue contributed to the situation.) 

Anyway. When I woke up in hospital I had my parents and my partner stood over me. My mother ( a nurse of 30 years) doing her best to not break down while asking how I felt. My dad not knowing what to say and my partner in tears. 

My mother told me that my older brother and 2 of my uncle's were in the waiting room. 

So... I had my parents, my brother and two uncle's race, in the middle of the night, half way across the country (literally) to be by my side. 

I vowed never to do that to them again, and equally as importantly, to me.

3 weeks later I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. That was 4 years ago. I'm still here. That was my moment.

Edit: Spelling mistake(s)"

Rant. The mental health system is broken and we have a long way to go.,"My name is Mia.

Canada is improving its mental health but lots more needs to be done.

My story is that I was sexually assaulted at work. (I have filed a police report). 
I now have PTSD and am unable to work due to daily panic attacks and nightmares every night. 

The workers compensation insurance board will pay for my counselling but not for my time off work because I was able to work for a few months before I broke down and my PTSD took over. 

I have doctor notes and psychiatric notes explaining that PTSD is an illness that can take months or years to show symptoms.

I have to wait 8 months to see a professional mental health counsellor which is covered by the insurance board. 

My city offers walk in counselling but you can only go 3 times per year.

I'm maxed out on walk in counselling,  and I still have months before counselling thought the workers compensation Insurance board starts. 

I have no money coming in and I'm unable to work. 

My car was reposed because I couldn't make the payments. 

The whole thing has been a living nightmare.

I have a few ideas for how to improve the mental health system:

- Offer a psychiatric assessment after a traumatic event covered by the workers compensation insurance. 

-Offer more education regards to mental illness and how it affects people. 

-Free counselling. Not 3 times max per year.

I'm scared, I fucked myself over so hard and I don't know what to do. 

i'm manic and bipolar and diagnosed with severe depression, and take meds for it and certain things really set me off and I don't know what to do, I feel like there's no other options, i've done everything I can. I can't find help anywhere. 

I had a manic phase and I borrowed money from a friend ($180), come to find out, this person is not as good of a person as I thought he was and he's been putting me in a really bad spot to get this money back and i'm trying i'm trying so hard, I don't know what to do.... It's only  been a day too. I shouldn't have done it. I'm so scared, I don't want my family to get hurt, or me get hurt or even worse then hurt. I don't want to have sex with him to pay him back I don't want to do any of that. I can't involve the police, I'm so terrified. I feel like I have NO OTHER options left, and I'm crying nonstop and I don't know... I'm freaking out. My parents won't help me I put myself in this position, I don't know what to do. What do I even do in this situation? I can't avoid him, he's my neighbor, I live alone, and I don't get paid till next week.

So I went to a mental hospital the other day,"It was voluntary, wasn’t sectioned or anything. Mental hospital / Detox. I’ve never been diagnosed for anything or gone out to seek help before but while I was there they gave me medication for my anxiety I was having. Now that I’ve been home my anxiety is even more off the rails than before. Is that because I’m no longer taking what they gave me. And does that mean I should be on something for it. Idk how anything works. My doctors aren’t open on Sundays ( tmm ) so here’s my next best guess to get advice from people with experience thanks."
I’m reborn.,"I was in two-5 year relationships, back to back. 

I lost myself. My friends. My family. My essence in life. My hobbies. My “Gainz”. Money. Dropped out of college three times. 

I was a husk of a human. Dry. Brittle. Alive only on the outside. 

My girl left me for someone else in October, maybe sooner—who knows really. And that’s when I was so far down that I had to reach up to touch rock bottom. 

It’s January 25, 2020. 
I am back. 
I am strong-willed. 
I am intelligent. 
I am funny. 
I am handsome. 
I am athletic. 
I am happy. 

I never thought I’d feel this way again but here I am. 
Happiness isn’t just “omg last night was so great!”  
Happiness is knowing you take the highs with the lows and you keep your chin up knowing everything will be ok. 
Happiness is choosing to LIVE. 
Happiness is rising from the ashes, rebuilding yourself...brick by brick. 
It’ll take a while to be 100%.
But that’s the beauty of it.

Emotional flash backs to my past,"I recently found some poems/lyrics I wrote in 2015. That was right in the middle of some very intense depression/soon to be drug addiction. I have been good and happy and have completely moved on from it all this past 2 years. But when I read these things I wrote I felt like it was 2015 again if that makes sense. For the past 2 weeks I will randomly feel dissociated, or confused, lost, incredibly scared and sad, etc. it goes away eventually. It feels much like how people describe a flash back. But it’s only with my emotions. Has anyone else had this kind of thing happen? People keep telling me to look at how far I have come and stuff like that. I’m pretty sure they don’t understand how bad it was and how scary it was for me? Or what I’m trying to tell them when I explain why I’m acting wierd all the sudden. Maybe I tried to hard on pushing my past away instead of working through it idk."
I need help,"I may sound like a typical 16 year old but I do think of suicide from time to time, I think of it but I know for sure that I will never actually do it because I don’t have the balls but thinking of how my problems would vanish helps me with my mind. My mind is always very disturbed and very distracted, I can never pay attention to anything because my mind is always racing this is causing me to fail academically because if I can’t focus on things that I love then I am screwed trying to pay attention in a classroom. Me not doing things correctly because I didn’t pay attention and people finishing a given task faster than I could make me think I’m stupid which then completely demolishes my self esteem. If you have any tips on how to deal with this I would appreciate you so much, I haven’t been at ease with my mind since I was a child and it’s ruining me."
I don't want to be in reality,"I have been using Internet as a coping mechanism since young age. Back then it felt literally relieving when I could chat with someone, browse some website after a day full of anxiety attacks and nausea. Now, it's like a different reality. I can find people who understand me at least in some ways. To clarify, I have some mental disorders. It started becoming hard to manage the real life. I still live with my fricking parents, I'm not able to have therapies, I have no friends and I feel like everyone in the real life are there to hurt me and abuse me. Just let me live. It's hard to pretend to be normal. When I mess something up, I'm the bad one. Well, sorry, I didn't choose to go through trauma as a child!

Is my friend ashamed of me? Help,We ve been friends for 5 years now but  everytime i make plans so we can go out he ignores me or cancels. The weird thing is that up close we pretty chill and have a lot of fun. I am very confused about this and don't know what to do.(sorry for bad English not my mother tongue)
"Looking for advice for getting back into ""life""","For the past 8 years, I would consider that I have lived a very closed life, when it comes sharing it someone else. To keep a long story short: I always had problems socializing with people, never really had confidence in myself, maybe due to delayed puberty, bullied by kids in school excessively, parental neglect, having poor nutrition as a teenager, being  ugly etc. Every little detail usually builds up into a systematic fault that keeps you feeling down, or is part of your general social awkwardness and anxiety.

At some point it was starting a bit more positive in life. Met someone I connected with, started to take care of myself more - mind you this was when I was 18-19. And then when I was 19 I got diagnosed with cancer. Hodgkin's lymphoma. Was planning to leave the country for the next summer with my girlfriend before starting our university studies, which I think quite a few young couples do. Instead she left me after my diagnosis, most of my friends stopped calling, visiting and I would always remember how some of the popular kids would generate crows of people to visit them - while I could not get even a single soul to show up at my place. Figured I was the issue, maybe all the times my parents said that ""Why am I not normal, like other kids?"" started to make sense. Yeah, maybe I am inadequate, unattractive and not worthy of human connection.

Throughout the treatment period (which was quite long) I became kind of a hermit, really only leaving home for food and to the hospital for treatments. I gained quite a lot of weight, because on the days I would feel better I would eat like a whale. That and getting hormone treatment to balance out my white blood cell count also messed with my body weight. Needless to say that additional weight that already did not help with my flabby body as it was, so the only thing I had for myself is that I was quite tall. 196cm or 6'5\~ish in height, so I did not look like a balloon, unless I turned to my side.

My confidence shattered ever so more. Already existing social anxiety at times would manifest into a panic and I had no self-esteem whatsoever. I sleepwalked through my university years and was later diagnosed with severe depression, to which I had to get treatment.

One of the minor breakthroughs in my life was that I realized that all the treatments and all this covering and being unable to do anything in my life will always escalate and if I don't do it using my own will - then I'll never change and I'll resent myself more and more. So I threw away my anti-depressants, called up the psych center and said I won't be coming in any more, because I think it's a waste of time and I'd rather do something more productive in life.

Managed to get an entry position IT job in a financial company. It did not pay a lot, but the salary was pretty good for a 23 year old that had basically no job experience. Hours were terrible at times, because of the shifting schedule and the tracked hours. Working at an IT help desk for a large financial company and dealing with many many problems at the same time will either break you or you'll thrive in this environment.

In my case - I thrived. Lot of people looked up to me for guidance, even though I still sometimes feel like I'm full of shit, when I try to give others advise or counsel on how to deal with problems. Worked there for almost two years until I got into a long-lasting argument with management, because I had a tendency to shake the status quo and try to make something happen, I would often stand up for my colleagues that made mistakes, but those mistakes were largely because of poor management. Anyways, it was a relatively toxic work environment, but I was glad that I could get that experience.

I still don't know if I really want to work in IT in general. It feels like a default option for me, due to the fact that I spent so much time with computers as a teenager, and in the later years, because I struggled connecting with people and was always ostracized. I only ever found comfort in technology and food.

Flash-forward to a few more recent years (I'm now 27). I'm still dealing with insecurity, confidence issues. I'd say that I'm too agreeable as well, when it comes to negotiating with other people. I'm unsatisfied the way I look, but in the least 1.5 years I managed to go from 277 (126 kilos roughly) to 209 (95 kilos). I'm still flabby, and have some excess skin hanging. I'm in the healthy BMI range, but still can definitely lose for my height and body frame somewhere between 10 kilos or so. Nutritionally I have more knowledge now as an adult, and I'm eating relatively clean and slowly building up lean mass and going through a full body re-composition. Lifting weights and exercise is definitely one of the things that helps my mood. That's probably why I exercise 5-6 times a week,  because it feels so damn good. I'm maybe thinking of doing something more functional, maybe picking up boxing. I think my body frame would suit it and the added discipline required to even participate in that hobby in the long run would improve my self-esteem.

 I'd say at the moment I am past the severe depression threshold which kept me in a pit of despair for the longest time, however at times I feel like I'm at edge of an abyss and I can fall at any time.

I still have trouble making new friends, or making a move towards the opposite sex, even if I occasionally get complimented by women. How does one become educated more in terms of dating people, meeting new people? I'm so envious of people, colleagues that let's say plan trips to far-away countries with friends and have hobbies built around circles of friends, while I don't really have anything like that, or have experienced such things in the past.

I just feel like no one would want such a broken person in their lives, and how could I possibly be a positive influence in someone's life?"
But what do I do about NOW?,"Yes, I know the stupid thing I said isn't going to matter in ten years. I know that it's not actually going to HURT me to do that thing I'm anxious over. But being rational about it doesn't help. What the hell am I supposed to do about how crippling my anxiety is right now? What do I do to make it hurt less now, when it actually matters to me?"
I'm struggling to stay happy,"Hi friends! I (18f) struggle with anxiety and depression, like a lot of people do unfortunately. I can't afford to delve into it more through doctors & therapy so I can't say what's going on with me for sure. I do have some medical issues which my doctors for that have explained will have an affect on my mental health, so I know that's part of it. I'm just frustrated because most of the time I feel so low, tired, and depressed. It's hard for me to enjoy anything or have the energy to try. But then every once in a while I'll get this HUGE burst of energy and excitement and I don't understand why I'm not happy all the time because life is pretty awesome a lot of the time. I'm starting to feel that feeling of happiness and excitement again which is great because I feel more productive, relaxed, and at peace. I'm just nervous because I know it won't last and I'll plateau back into my low state, and I really really don't want that to happen. I want to feel good and encouraged and confident, but I can't really control when it hits me. Does anyone have any advice on how I can keep my spirits up and not let myself fall back into that hole?"
What's wrong with me?,"I keep ruminating over my mental health, existential questions, and I'm afraid I'm going to go insane. Reality feels far away, I try to ground myself but my existential worries makes it difficult. It's like reality has been watered down to shapes and I can't engage myself. I get panic attacks on and off. I'm so afraid of going insane that I have a panic attack whenever I look at any media portraying mental illness. I was fine until I had a mental breakdown at the end of my first semester in college. I was stressed and depressed and finally caved in, but I've never been hit this hard before. Every moment I'm awake I ruminate over these fears. Does anyone know what this could be?"
When/why to go to a psychiatrist?,"Hello,

Recently I asked my GP to give me an official recommendation to a psychiatrist. She wasn't too happy about it and kept insisting to give me medication instead.

I refused it because I want to know what's wrong with me rather than be on medication for a symptom which might have a deeper cause. I will also add that I've been visiting therapists for years but with no help.

The issues I face I would describe as depression, anxiety and social anxiety mixed but it doesn't exactly feel that way? I don't feel depressed and it weirds me out when I describe my symptoms and people immediately call it depression. I feel the happiest I've ever been.

I might be overstressed but it feels odd that just having a ""normal"" job would stress me to the degree that it looks like depression. I mean, there nothing extra stressful but my job in my life. The symptoms basically is that doing ANYTHING is very difficult, I feel exhausted and just resting after work is ideal, even doing basic hygiene requires me to cut it down to the small steps and having a reminder on phone. I have almost no hobbies and no motivation for anything.

As for anxiety, that could be it but it doesn't define my issue altogether either. It feels like a part of something bigger. I have common anxiety attacks and just anxiety is almost omnipresent in my life.

Social anxiety is odd one in my case, because I don't have issues with large groups with one common conversation or even speaking in front of large groups but I'm practically mute in a group (even smaller one) with multiple on-going conversations. I also love meeting new people and people in general but following all social cues and ready body language is exhausting and since I work with clients at work, I don't have any more energy for more strangers but friends actually energise me because I have to watch for that less. It's like, I love people but it's hard work to know what to say, to read between the lines, to read body language etc.

I also realised I have huge memory issues, where people tell me stories about me that I don't remember even if it happened about 5 years ago.

My attention span is very short, I have to do multiple things at once because I can't pay attention to just one. I'm not sure if it's related to any of the above but I tend to jump in conversations, mix up information, sentences, etc.

I'm just tired of it all and I want to know what's wrong with me but I'm not sure if this is something I should go to a psychiatrist with.

Thank you for your input."
Take 2: A Letter to the Public on Behalf of Playbuzz,
Is slapping a kid on the face abuse?,"I mean for things that are not super major or super minor. For example talking back to your parents. I used to get slapped hard on the face for doing that. I get what I did was wrong, and it doesn’t happen anymore since I’m 20 now, but it happened frequently enough as a kid that it makes me feel kinda bad when I think about it. 

From what I’ve heard, spanking a child is considered bad but not abusive. Is slapping considered to be the same? My parents never acted in bad faith, more like tough love. It did get kinda out of hand though I guess. I got screamed at a lot for things like a bad grade. I know at their core my parents love me and would never do anything outside of my best interest, but sometimes I think of how they treated me and feel kinda bad about it. It was mostly just face slapping and yelling but it got worse on two occasions which I don’t wanna talk about here.  But basically Asian tiger parents. 

So my question is, could this be considered abusive behavior? Or does it have to be in bad faith for it to qualify as such?"
I'm so miserable,WHAT THE FUCK IM MUSERABLE DONT ASK ME TO ADD TEXT FUCK THE MODS WTF
So this is me having an existential crisis again,"This is my 8th year on therapy, I'm 19. I've been to 5 different psychologists, but I always go back to being depressed and feeling like doing something bad to myself. I always have to improve and I always try to do what the therapists tell me, however I feel like it doesn't pay off. 
I'm so tired of trying to improve myself, I don't want to go to a psychologist anymore, I don't want to go to a psychiatrist anymore. I want to be normal like everyone, but if I do that I'll end up killing myself.  It makes me wonder if I'm destined to killing myself, is my natural instinct or whatever. 
I wish I had a reason to cry, because at least it would make my sadness meaningful and I would know how to make it better. 
I do feel happy sometimes.
I just want to find the reason to my sadness so I can end it"
Loss of a therapist,Has anyone ever lost a therapist? My therapist of 5 1/2 years suddenly stopped seeing patients in June and I just found out he passed away. I have had a new provider since June but am unable to process this loss. He took me from a very dark place and got me out of it so I truly feel like I am living today because of him.  Any thoughts or advice
Is medication worth it?,"Anyone who has tried antidepressants or anti anxiety medication, does it actually help? I’ve heard and read so many mixed things I don’t know what to think anymore. I’ve always tried to avoid prescription drugs as much as possible but taking things into my own hands doesn’t seem to be having consistent results for me. I am definitely concerned about the negative health  effects of medication so I’d like to get some input on whether or not people think it’s worth it. Thank you."
What is my problem?,"Hello.

Let's get straight to the point, I don't know what my problem is. All my life I have felt disconnected from people and have had trouble socializing, though I can be charismatic and gain friendships, but I can sometimes be so awkward I don't retain friendships for long. I tend to feel empathy towards people but most of my emotions are extremely basic, for example, I could feel \*SAD\* for a friend, but that is about it. I could also feel deeply connected to someone I know (be it a family member or a friend). I know this is weird but I sometimes feel such a lack of emotions and a lack of basic hard-wired emotions like, for example, a sex drive. I lack a developed sex drive and almost always feel nothing. I lack complex emotions yet I can be quite emotional at times. I don't know what is wrong with me and it's ruining my social life.

I have had fantasies about hurting animals and I have hurt animals in the past. I will not shy away from this, I can admit it is pretty sick but I can't help myself. Sometimes I just want to strange a rabbit to death or hurt it in ways no human being should. I'm sorry. What could be wrong with me? has anyone had any experience with these emotions/actions? I need answers"
Reactive psychosis or something else?,"So I’m 18 years old now. It started at the end of August (when I was 17) once I was finishing up my internship before 12th grade would begin. I had become unhealthily obsessed with fluoride and felt a prick on my upper left arm causing me to suspect that someone shot me with a small poison dart. It got much much worse as time went on. I started feeling pricks all over my body that made me think there was a small government controlled fly that would inject drugs and poison in me, I kept checking behind me to see if anyone was following me, there was a blue light in the sky that I felt was following me and reading my mind (the blue light is not a hallucination because other people saw it too), any van that I saw I would memorize and write down it’s license plate to see if it’d come again a second time because I felt that a listening station was in there, any stranger who’d look at me my way would be automatically labeled as someone who is spying on me and wants to rape and kill me and my family, I thought there was a stranger in my house who was hiding and I’d check underneath the beds every day just to be sure. I felt like I was in the Truman Show at one point as if everything was fake and scripted and when anyone would look at me I’d think that it was because my actions were being recorded and put in the internet without my knowledge. Any call we’d get over the intercom made my heart jump because it basically felt like that one Men At Work song (Who can it be now).I’d worry about my moms safety and her lack of care for privacy over the internet. Eventually I’d stop using the computer and then the phone. In fact I went from my Samsung S8 to an iPhone because I heard that they can’t be hacked or wherever but I found ways to make myself believe it was hacked by scrutinizing the battery activity every fucking morning (and if a message would send alittle slower then the previous one I’d suspect that a hacker intercepted it or whatever) I destroyed that iPhone to bits to leave no evidence and got another one. And then another one, but it was the same deal. Sometimes I was able to man up and use it for brief period of time if I absolutely needed to (such as for school or to call my mom) but most of the time I’d put it on airplane mode and shut it off. I never felt safe using it. I always felt someone was watching me through the camera (I also covered my parents laptop cam). I got kaspersky on my pc and would run a full scan (would approx take 2 hours) in addition to a root kit scan atleast once a day and it would only give me temporary solace. Anything that I did would only give me temporary solace. No amount of visits to local technicians or the geek squad telling me everything is normal would help calm me down. This was all during highschool, but actually being in school was the best part about this because socializing with my friends/making new ones and still maintaining great grades would help me distract myself most of the time, but it would get worse. My mom eventually took me to a psychiatrist in December or January and he wasn’t confident in his answer (that being schizophrenia) but he didn’t know what else it could be. His other theory was some sort of OCD because I was lacking the cardinal symptoms of schizophrenia (isolation, lack of hygiene, dipping grades, some form of hallucination, belief in super powers, being emotionally flat etc). He also suspected it was OCD because I talked about some symptoms such as putting things a certain way to avoid dying or writing things a certain way to avoid dying or just doing very specific things to avoid dying (but I’d argue that was because I was scared shitless and not because of OCD) So at the start of 2019 he put me on my first anti psych (forgot the name) and when that didn’t work after a month he put me on risperidone, but it made me very shaky and restless so we switched it out to Thorazine which made me super super tired (all of these anti psychs did but this one especially) and ran it’s 2 month course to no results. It was just getting worse. He put me back on risperidone because he didn’t feel we ran it’s entire course and he added another drug to combat the jitteriness which was very distracting to me. At this point in time (mid to late 12th grade) I was in a prodromal clinic researching the early stages of schizophrenia which they concluded I had and they gave me money to do tests and MRI’s and stuff and that was fine and all because I was also starting to have suicidal thoughts and I felt that “if I’m going to die then I might as well contribute something”. My psychiatrist also tried ruling out any diseases or sub seizures via the week long EEG they sent me home with to moniter my brain when sleeping (it was fucking torturous and it lead to nothing). After my international school trip that my parents almost took me out of because of my deteriorating condition (I’m glad they didn’t because I had the best time of my life there despite the paranoia and fear) and then the graduation, things got way way worse because now I didn’t have school. I was in no way shape or form going back the the computer nor my phone (even though I took it everywhere because I was scared it’d get stolen if I left it home and even at home I’d hide it at night so no one would sneak in and hack it). Nowhere felt safe except when I went to my psychologists who watched it all unfold. Eventually my psychiatrist stopped beating around the bush and put me on clozapine which he described as the best med to fight against paranoia. I took it and took it and took it and it made me feel even worse. I resented taking it but what fucking choice did I have? I was fucking hopeless and out of answers and I spoke openly to my family about jumping out my window or just getting a gun somehow and blowing my brains out. It’s the summer and after voicing my thoughts to my psychiatrist and psychologist they thought I should go to a mental hospital to not commit suicide. So I agreed (I wanted to go to thinking it would help) and there I was. My mom admitted me and after waiting in the ER for an eternity I was wheelchaired off into the psych wing and I stayed there for a month as they experimented with different doses and combinations of meds but nothing was working, I just went through uncomfortable side effects. I met some nice people there though and heard their backstories, but others who were far worse off than I were also incredibly scary to me and felt they were plotting to kill me. On one of the last days I had a session with a medical professional and my mom and she officially diagnosed me with schizophrenia and I was just really devastated because she also told me there’s no cure and I felt like I had lost. We left the hospital in late august and I decided to take a gap semester for the college I was accepted to. I was still on clozapine with an increasing dose, but about a month in I started using my moms laptop or my grandmas computer more frequently to catch up on all the YouTube vids I missed. I’d also make calls to my friends I haven’t spoken to in months from my moms phone. I also had a job at the time too.  But overall I was still very scared to go outside and argued back and forth with my parents about people sneaking and killing us and hidden cameras being everywhere. The psychiatrist realized clozapine wasn’t working so he started tapering off around October. I started watching YouTube vids on my parents laptop now, but it was still unnerving because I had to leave off on a video where nothing about death or something like that was mentioned because then I’d believe that it would happen to me. Then one day, on December 9th 2019 I was invited to my friends party across town and my mom said that if I wanted to go then I had to turn on my phone and so I did and nothing bad happened. I haven’t turned off my phone since. I turned my pc some time later and was playing games and talking to everyone again. I got social media again and reconnected with highschool and middle school friends again and nowadays I’m feeling like myself again. I don’t think about any of the hackers or killers anymore and if I do then I shrug it off. I’m not on anything anymore and haven’t been for 3+ months. So what the hell happened? I visited my psychiatrist a week ago and he was glad to hear the news and he said it might’ve been a “brief” reactive psychosis, but he wasn’t too sure. My psychiatrist thinks it was a result of the mental and physical abuse my dad put me through and I was subconsciously expressing it through fear. It makes more sense to me because now I’m angrier at the world than ever before, especially at my fucking loser of a dad. I’d like to hear your thoughts in the matter because I’m really confused. Thanks! 


TL DR: I started fearing for my own life and felt everyone was going to kill me and became super paranoid about hackers and stuff so I went on meds and nothing worked and they diagnosed me with Schizophrenia at a mental hospital I was in for a month because they didn’t know what else it was, but as I was coming off of my anti psych meds I felt gradually felt back to normal. Thoughts?"
Tired of saying sorry,"I apologise to coworkers,friends,relatives,strangers way too much. And I don't mean in a bumping into someone and saying sorry politely.

I mean if I get in an argument or altercation I'm always saying sorry first or trying to make up with people but fuck em. I'm not doing it anymore.

It's not my problem if you don't like me, I'm not keeping the peace anymore. When people threaten and shout at me, they should say sorry. I'm not a punching bag.

The thing is that I'm a pretty cheeky/jokey person and I don't mean any harm but people are just annoying"
Insecure about my ethnicity,"I've struggled with anxiety and depression for a few years now, ever since middle school(21M) and it comes and goes throughout my life. But recently something happened that has pushed me to a dark place. It's a really long story but I'll try to compress it as well as I can while being clear. I met this girl in my sophomore year of college and I had a crush on her. But we only talked once in person, as she dropped the class soon after because it was too difficult. But we messaged each other on Twitter. In the beginning everything went great. We had alot in common and I really did enjoy her company and her personality. The first time she smiled at me while in class I was blushing and was so happy inside.

But then she started to ghost me, she said that she had no interest in talking to me. We got into an argument and we both blocked each other in the heat of it. But I felt guilty and I unblocked her, she did the same thing the day after, yet I never found out why. Within the next few months after she would start to stalk my Twitter page and subtweet about things I said that had nothing to do with her  I feel guilty because I did the same. We threw insults to each other back and forth through subtweets. She said horrible things about me. It got so bad that I started to receive death threats sent to me from burner accounts about my ethnicity. Saying things like,

>Why would she ever want to be friends with a a stupid Mexican like you?

>Go jump over the wall back to Mexico and kill yourself.

I confronted her about it begging her to stop, that a line was crossed and that this act was immensely disgusting and vile. She  messaged me saying that she had no idea about the threats and would never say that. She said that she ""forgave"" me because she falsely accused me of abusing, and manipulating her. I was so confused what I said that she was referring to. But that was the last I heard of her. I have conflicting feelings for her, there's a part of me that cares about the person I thought she was but there's another part of me that thinks she's a vile, horrible, thing.

My mental health has been so screwed throughout that experience and in the aftermath. I've been insecure about my ethnicity ever since. I hate the color of my skin and the fact that I'm Hispanic. She's a white girl and I will never be good enough for her as long as I'm not a white guy. I can't sleep and when I wake up, I have no energy to get up. I constantly breakdown crying over how I feel about the situation and myself. I can't stop thinking about what she said to me and how much I miss her. I feel like I'm insane for thinking like that. I started having suicidal thoughts because I feel so alone and unwanted. It's hard for me to make genuine friends and for a while I really thought she and I could have been friends. And I'm scared because I'm in so much pain and I just want this feeling to stop. I wish I could have a serious conversation with her about the entire situation between me and her and try to give us both some form of closure but I can't. This has been going on for almost two years now and my mind has been going to dark places. I don't know what I'm going to do."
Just called my cities 24/7 crisis line.,It helped. She was a trained therapist and helped me get out of the head space I was in just enough to keep me from self harming. I was super nervous to call and thought my crisis wasn't legitimate. I strongly encouraged anyone to take advantage of this resource if it's available. No crisis is to small.
Help.,"   
Hello everybody,

So I've been silently suffering with mental health for as long as I can remember. I'm 18 years old and I don't even remember a time where I didn't suffer. It started in 9th grade where I took off my glasses(because I couldn't bear seeing my reflection), wore a hoodie all the time (even  when sleeping) , and my acne went through the roof. I considered suicide sometimes but I know it wasn't for me. I slowly got ""better"" in the 10th grade, where I took off my hoodie. Mind you I didn't get any help. I came clean to my parents about why they didn't help me and their response was ""Well I told you to take off the hoodie multiple times"". I was always envy of my cousins because they got more love from their parents. I always felt burning inside when I saw their moms cuddling them and kissing them when I didn't get any.Fast Forward to later on in 11th grade where I was relatively happy. In 12th grade, I met this girl in class. I always used to see her around. She is drop-dead gorgeous. But I never talked to her before because I didn't want to have anything based on looks, until she sat next to me in class. We immediately clicked. Being besides her was heaven. We got into this relationship for about  a year. I was happy, very happy. It was the happiest I've ever been. Well,school ended, and I had to travel to uni  in Canada(I live in Lebanon, middle-east). We've always known that I had to travel, but she never accepted it until I told her I bought the ticket. She snapped. Basically, I spent the last 2 months in Lebanon weeping and having sleep-less nights. Let me tell you, being in that bad of a mental state fucking drains you. I worked out for 3 hours everyday for what seemed like forever because I wanted to tire myself and just not think of it. We tried to be friends, but let me tell you, it never works and just drains you out. I got better over time before traveling, and we made up, and hugged goodbye.To also mention, I'm 100% sure I have had ocd since I was a child, but no one took me seriously.When I first arrived to Canada, I was fucking depressed as shit. I hated my decision. I was lonely. A lonely 17 year old 18 hours away from home. That wasn't good for my mental health. I promised myself that I wouldn't ever consider suicide, so my goal is now to die for a cause. That way, I can leave an impact, and just rest. I have no problem dying this moment. I don't fear death, which honestly frightens me sometimes.I see this world as wortheless, the only goal, other than dying for a cause, is to help as much people as I can.Also, throughout these 4 years, I've tried to diagnose myself, as I couldn't have access to any mental health help. I think I have depression, ADHD, ocd, and some form of schizophrenia? (I feel like my brain/me are separated, and my brain often has the upper hand. Somewwhat like being trapped inside a cage inside of my own body-think dean winchester trapped in when micheal took over his body).Because of everything that happened, and having no one to vent to, I've gotten used to burying shit down. My head is fucking fried. I feel locked out of my own brain, like there's some kind of wall preventing me from accessing it. This has been going on for like 2 years, it only got worse after the girl thing). This prevents me from fully using my mental capacity. I don't know how to fully put it into words. I am dead inside. I've lost all emotion except for stress, anger, and laughter. It's like my brain put this wall up as some sort of defense mechanism to keep me going. I don't know what to do. I'm lost. I live a normal life, excel in studies, volunteer, was top of my class, a 9,75 gpa...I feel like my goal is to just make other people happy, as It's the only thing that actually can make me genuinely happy anymore.

Help

I don't know what to do, only a few people know of my mental state, and they choose to do nothing. I only see the gray in the world. I've been so accustomed to depression and sadness I'm afraid of letting go in fear of losing my personality.

tldr; Dead inside, lost emotion, only goal in life is to make other people happy/die for a cause. I don't want to be not depressed.

Thanks"

Messed Up friendship,"I have a friend with bpd, and right now I'm their to. My friend with bpd(let's call her Janice), has been dealing with it for a long time. She's too ashamed of her past to do anything, but I'm slowly coercing her. This isn't the issue though, just some backstory. Lately, my other friend(let's call him Stan), has recently shown a lot of toxic traits and such. This includes: talking about me behind my back,insulting my sexuality, referring to me as less than a man bc of my sexuality, and more. He's jealous of me and Janice's relationship, though he doesn't want to admit it. Lately,Janice didn't know what to do, she was talking Abt how Stan could be her next do, she just feels smth with him. I'm normally fine with us talking Abt it, I never wanted to be her for, just be good friends, (and we alrdy reconciled after some things), so we were back on good terms. But I was bothered by him. He doesn't think of fp as an obsession, he thinks of it as a relationship. I had to help Janice with so many of her issues, and he just levels it to a gf bf type of thing. I'm rambling on, but, we're lost and we're trying to figure out what to do. She's scared, and I don't want to see her go back to her old self, and become too scared to help herself again"
extremely messed up sexually?? is this normal?? please help i'm desperate,"I've seen two posts like this on reddit before long ago but I figured it was time for my vent.

I masturbate to extremely fucked up things. Over half after I'd finish, I'd feel depressed or suicidal even because of the contents. When I am not in the state of arousal, I find the thing so repulsing (multiple things, all severely fucked up) except one which I find to be a general attraction. The thing I just got off to was so fucking messed up.

I've gotten off to r\*pe articles about women telling their story while crying and that's on the mild side. I'm more disgusted with some rather then others, since once I stop being aroused it's the most disgusting thing ever. Other things sometimes, doesn't even phase me since I've known that isn't an arousal thing, it's a general attraction.

I've looked at stuff like this but I keep finding too mild of things that barely border what I think about. It can be extremely depressing since some of the things are really fucked up and when I think about them again I feel sick with myself. I've found some of the things not to be even disgusting after a while. I can't mention if I don't want my account to get suspended though.

Is this normal to have extremely fucked up sexual fantasies when aroused then when you come off the arousal, you fucking hate yourself because it was so fucked up even though you were just previously intensely aroused?

If anyone who isn't gonna tell me to kill myself or is extremely open to certain things would let me to vent and give advice, I'd be so happy. Thanks to any replies and let's hope this doesn't get banned :("
My (32F) husband (34M) has trouble reaching climax due to the antidepressant cocktail he’s on. What can I do to help aside from him changing medications?,"First off, my husband needs all of these medications. If he comes off of them, he loses touch with reality and things get really bad, even dangerous (towards himself). 
Our sex life is suffering because of this. He is amazing and always makes sure I’m more than taken care of, but he simply does not get off and more often than not, he ends up in pain.
Realistically speaking, I know this isn’t my fault, but it really affects my self esteem to the point where I dread and even avoid sex. It’a extremely important to me that he gets off and every time he doesn’t, I feel myself shutting down a little more. This is made worse by the fact that we are trying to have a baby....

I love this man with all of my heart and can’t see myself with anyone else. How can I help him reach climax? He doesn’t have issues with getting an erection, just the end part. 
Any advice, links and books are welcomed. 

Thank you. 

TL;DR my husband cannot reach climax due to medication and I want to know what I can do in order to help him."
Hope this helps someone else.,
How do i cope?,"I have brain cancer. I'm in  israel right now i moved here 2 years ago from the philippines to study in a program that accepts kids from all over the world and put them in a boarding school. I developed brain cancer recently and is dependent on the program to give us housing, rides to the hospital, insurance. The thing is i cant study while getting treatment so I'm afraid they'll just kick me out and i wont be able to get treatment. It's giving me a lot of anxiety. How can I cope?"
"My friends are always moving on, but to things I’m not interested in.","It’s odd watching the friends you grew up with and the ones in your age group having kids and settling into parent roles.  You think to yourself of all the reasons you missed out on that sometimes.

And someday you wake up and realize why.  It’s because you aren’t willing to buy into or believe that family fantasy is right for you.  You realize that fantasy is a lie based on a presumption that everything will be ok in the future and someone has to be making sure that things are so, right?

You wake up and realize that there are people who believe to their core that money is more important than human existence.  They think that the old ways of making money will be the way of the future, as evidence piles up, year after year, that proves the opposite.  

You realize that if you have children, their lives might be fucked with societal turmoil like never imagined, that could have been prevented, if more people wouldn’t have fallen into a false dream, that leads to death for everyone."
This guy does realize that bullying causes mental health effects right?,"https://donotlink.it/wJ5q

The guy talks about this transgendered student who planned a shooting here: https://heavy.com/news/2019/05/alec-maya-mckinney/

>See, if you advocate locking up teenage dopeheads as juvenile delinquents, you’re racist or something. If you advocate locking up these maladjusted weirdos in psychiatric wards, you’re stigmatizing mental illness. Disapproving of sexual perversion makes you guilty of transphobia. Instead, now everyone is required to celebrate diversity and inclusion, which means keeping the drug-addled misfits in public high school and interpreting their unpopularity as “bullying,” because how dare your normal teenager not want to hang out with a couple of losers like this? And then one day, the freaks decide it would be really cool to shoot up the school more or less randomly. which then becomes an argument for (a) gun control and (b) more “anti-bullying” policies to protect deranged misfits from social disapproval.

>The world has gone crazy because expressing common sense will get you banned from social media and/or fired from your job.

Even though its shown that bullying is the cause of mental health issues and drug use and not the other way around. http://homoresponse.blogspot.com/2011/06/mental-health-and-substance-abuse.html

He acts as if it's all about them not being popular. https://kathrynhgordon.com/2018/05/14/fact-checking-5-suicide-related-statements-from-a-viral-ben-shapiro-video/

We see these people be harassed and he thinks ""aw does no one want to be with the freak?"" 

Even though it turns out the ""malajustments"" and drug use are in a response to being bullied.

See here: https://jech.bmj.com/content/70/3/223
>However, this perception is not borne out by the research literature available on the subject. Those with mental illness make up a small proportion of violent offenders. A recent meta-analysis by Large et al4 found that in order to prevent one stranger homicide, 35 000 patients with schizophrenia judged to be at high risk of violence would need to be detained. This clearly contradicts the general belief that patients with severe mental illness are a threat.

Off course he promotes the idea that ""Crazy People are Dangerous"" and he focuses on Transgender people being violent, because he sees gender dysphoria as a mental illness.

>Suicide by cop,” apparently. In a statement on their Facebook page, the Pride Alliance continues the “they/their/them” pronoun charade, as if the delusions of a knife-wielding lunatic deserve respect. It never seems to occur to these activist types that acting as enablers to the mentally ill — and demanding that the rest of us play along with the “gender” game — actually makes them complicit in the deaths of such deranged people. Scout Schultz needed psychiatric treatment, not identity politics.

>“When I said that the mentally ill should be in institutions, public universities weren’t the kind of institutions I had in mind.”

>The counterfactual ideology of transgenderism is a formula for madness. As much as we might pity the sufferers of “gender dysphoria,” political correctness is no substitute for mental-health treatment.

>The transgender community is full of nutjobs like “Natalie Reed,” a former junkie who claims to suffer from depression, anxiety and PTSD. To put it quite plainly he/“she” is crazy, and this kind of craziness (“comorbidity”) is commonplace among transgender people. Should we rearrange the social order to accommodate their irrational demands? Should we allow lunatic perverts to dictate our laws? And why are universities accommodating this maladaptive behavior?

First off the comorbidity is due to discrimination: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/dlmxyx/why_is_there_a_high_comorbidity_between_gender/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5825045/ https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ps.201800232&ved=2ahUKEwjgiPTH4erkAhXCwFkKHTFJC5YQFjAMegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw3GNLsVzSaROEQOZKmUUkQX

The concept of Adverse Childhood Events has only come to my attention recently, and after doing some searching, I realized...wow, I might have had some.  A few.  Like, one every couple of years, right into adulthood.  It took me an hour to document them, and I haven’t even gotten to 20 and beyond (35F).

Thing is, none of them were brought on by abuse or neglect.  I never went without things I needed.  I had a good family, all told.  Just...bad luck, unfortunate things happening over and over that caused me fear and avoidance.  I *perceived* them as a trauma, sometimes for good reason.  But they don’t seem to fit any of the communities.  Hell, even the ACE test asks about nothing but abuse and neglect situations—don’t get me wrong, those are tragic and awful, but what about medical trauma, or someone who’s never had anything but shit luck from the get-go?

For instance, being in a car wreck at age ten.  Our van hit a patch of ice and spun out and slammed into a highway guard rail.  Nobody was seriously injured, but for a long time afterward I was terrified of riding somewhere when there was snow and ice on the roads.  I didn’t want to do it, but I didn’t get a choice, sat and just oscillated with terror in the backseat until I could finally escape.

I choked on candy, twice, had to go to the ER the second time.  I had a van bench seat dropped on my head.  Being separated from family for the first time to go to school made me cry every day for weeks.  I was in a car fire.  I *hated* getting stomach flu and freaked out every single time it happened.  I panicked when it happened to other family members, afraid I would catch it too.

And when I was thirteen my body suddenly decided I had emetophobia.  I started having panic attacks that still happen regularly to this day.  Just had one right now.  I know I’m not in any danger, but they’re still goddamn terrifying.  And there’s no escaping them.  They can strike any time.

And now I’m wondering how all this has affected me as an adult.  I have quit more jobs than I’ve kept because the pressure of working eventually threw me into a downward spiral of panic attacks.  Now I’m in a high-stress job (THAT was a mistake) I can’t quit because I have no money and no one to support me.  My boss is great and literally gives me half the workload other people do, and sometimes it’s still too much.  

My siblings, who experienced almost no adverse events, have gone on to successful careers and “normal” lives.  But me, it’s like my stress response is just broken.  Like the pathways were laid in my brain a long, long time ago, and now that’s just how it reacts, regardless of the actual severity of the situation.  All the panic, all the time.

I take meds and practice mindfulness, but it’s still frustrating and exhausting.  I wonder what it’s doing to my future health.  I’m in the process of looking for a suitable therapist, but I guess I just wanted some feedback that I’m not imagining this or making it up.  If I belong in another community, that’s fine too.  I just can’t seem to find much help for people who’ve been screwed over from the start, through the direct fault of absolutely no one.

Thanks for reading."
What the fuck is wrong with my brain?,"I honestly just want to know what all is wrong with me (I know the only way to get a formal diagnosis is through a therapist, they told me I had a “unidentified anxiety disorder”, but I didn’t open up truthfully about everything to them at that point in my life)...anyways let me go into some symptoms/daily life.

-Every few days my mood switches from being really motivated and ready to take on the world to really fucking depressed
-When bored I just start thinking of ways to kill myself.  Not taking it seriously, just for entertainment.  Almost as a joke
-I abuse certain drugs (Weed, Pain killers, Dissociatives [a favorite of mine] etc) 
-Really bad anxiety
-Really low self confidence and self esteem
-Sometimes eat nothing but sweet foods, sometimes eat nothing
-Really bad mood swings

That’s all that I can think of right now tbh. Sorry to bother all y’all.  Anybody who kind of knows this shit, if you could drop a comment it’d be appreciated.  Have a nice day y’all."
"Do I have ""proper"" anxiety? (Advice needed)","TW;; RAPE, DOMESTIC ABUSE 
B.INFO;; 19, F, UK

i don't really know how to write this because i don't want to seem like im crying for help. 

for the past year and bit, i've had terrible anxieties about everything. i stress about the littlest things like what if my period doesn't come and what if I get told off and to the biggest things like what if my boyfriend hates me and moves onto someone else? or I'm not pretty enough. i grew up in a very old fashioned household with stigmas towards mental health being ""a phase"" and ""will get over it"" and i never get the chance to vent how i'm feeling.

this bit can get triggering so i apologise in advance but I did warn before. 

it wouldn't be surprising that i probably have anxiety because I'm only 19 but my life has been not the most enjoyable. unfortunately i was raped when I was 16 by the first boyfriend. with the same boyfriend at the age of 16, he was very abusive to me and he did a lot of physical violence to me with the extreme of breaking my collarbone and dislocating my knee. i felt so ashamed that i couldn't tell anyone and that lead me to thinking that everyone found out and that they all hated me because i let it happen to myself.  

i'm always on edge, thinking that i won't get into my university, that my family hate me, my boyfriend will leave me for someone new because i was not good enough or pretty enough.

it's driving me insane and i feel like i can't go a day without worrying about everything and it's like i have a constant war going on in my brain. 

i don't know what to do and a bit of me is too scared to tell anyone and too scared to actually get diagnosed because i'm terrified because i don't want to admit it to myself."
I feel like my mental issues aren't as big of a deal as they might be and I can't help but feel like all I've been going through is fake,"I have been struggling with my mental health for about 7 years at the least (18F), I've been self harming and I suspect I am struggling from some form of depression for the duration of those years, that have only been amplified by bullying throughout my middleschool years, social isolation, loneliness, family issues and issues regarding my sexuality.
I've had periods of self harm through those past few years in various ways and have dealt with suicidal thoughts and thoughts of not wanting to exist.
When I entered highschool things have improved for me to a degree, I met a lot of new people that have helped me feel better and that helped ease my problems and how I coped with some things.
I've improved a lot, yet lately I feel like I've been falling in that pit of depression once again due to stress, existential dread and a feeling of intense loneliness, which all lead to me telling my mom about how I've been feeling awful and need help during my lowest point.
She understood and found a therapist for me, yet at this moment I just feel like I over exaggerated my problems and don't need any help, and that all of this has been just some form of attention seeking.
Even writting this down feels like a plea for attention from strangers.
I feel like maybe all of my issues have been fake as fuck and that I'm fine.

I find my way through the thick film of my own volatile rage to find myself slinking slowly as my skin sloughs off like silt. 
The bright, heated surety of indignation dims and I feel my consciousness move, fly past rational thought and inward with loathing. 
I don’t have anything out there anymore. 
I’ll sleep in the hollow husk of my torso.

My head I fucked,"I can't maintain a relationship no matter how much I love a person after a bit of time some time as few months some times a year I can't bare to talk to them all of a sudden. I lose all emotion for them and they become strangers and I then cut them off completely it is as tho it turns to complete boardem instantly litterly I wake up one morning or think about it and I'm instantly turned away. It's almost like post wank clarity but it never goes away I just feel sick and confused as to why I cared so much. I do this with almost every thing friends , relationships and hobbies. I also have a very strong call of the void that is very very active in my head ,not to the point where I am fighting it but Its always there 'step Infront of that bus' , 'cut your throught on that glass' wherever I am even in my dreams lucid and unconscious it's there. It's like my mind is just trying to be self destructive and the second i find anything good it makes me have no feeling for it and it's getting harder and harder. I just ended an 8 month relationship for no reason other than  I lost all my love one morning and couldn't bare to keep up a conversation with them, I went from being willing to take a bullet to them being a compete stranger and I'm terrified of it . I've broken this girls heart who I cared for so much and I'm conscious of what I've done but I feel no effect.

How to help my girlfriend?,"How do I help my girlfriend?

Hi. I’ll try to keep this short. This girl I work with and me started dating 7 months ago. When she first began to work there, she had a boyfriend in jail but they broke up and then we became a couple a week later. She is 19 and I’m 25, so a lot of her issues probably are due to age. Anyways, everything was good in the relationship. We spent all our time together and loved being around each other. She was with me every night and pretty much all the time because we worked together. Other than her snooping  through my phone in fear that I was cheating on her, there was no problem. She said she was so in love with me and i was and still am in love with her. However, as soon as the ex got out of jail I figured out she spent a whole day and night with him, while ignoring me and saying she was out with family. I told her what I knew and broke up with her. She denied ever seeing him, but felt things were different and it wouldn’t work because I don’t trust her anymore. We kept hanging out though and she expressed that she loved me and wanted to work things out. After about a week, I just didn’t see the relationship going anywhere because my trust was fucked up, so I told her I was going to Miami for three days and then she flipped out. She felt like I abandoned her and didn’t love her anymore and went back to her ex.

After two weeks, the ex already fucked up and she was calling me back. We started talking again for two weeks and the first time we hung out I realized two other guys (one another ex boyfriend and one I’m not sure who he is) were texting her. Once we started hanging out again constantly, I no longer saw any other guys texting her except for the ex she had broke up with who blows up her phone all day everyday on fake numbers because she blocked him. She acted like she wanted to be in a committed relationship again, but I wasn’t willing to commit because she had just broke up with her ex and I wanted to make sure there was no mix feelings. Now it has been three months since then and we are always together just like we were before. I asked her last night if she wanted to be committed again and she said no because she was afraid I would leave her because I didn’t want to commit for so long (still not owning up to the fact that she saw her ex in October and that me leaving was really her fault) and I told her I didn’t want to commit to someone who likely had mixed feelings for two men, but now she seems to hate him so I’m more comfortable with commitment.Then she understood and said she wanted to be in a relationship again, so now we are a couple again.

I love this girl to death. She  is my first love and took my virginity. I know, a late bloomer I am. But it seems like she can’t be alone. She always has to be in a relationship. She even said when she is alone she starts having bad thoughts and she tried to kill herself twice before. She has no friends, doesn’t like to go out in public unless it’s for work due to social anxiety, and just likes to be in bed all day with me. I’m not sure why she decided to see her ex that day, but maybe it’s because younger guys will say stuff like “we will be together forever” where I’m older and more realistic and would say stuff like “if we are still together in three months...” which she would point out and it would make her feel insecure. Or maybe it’s because we are interracial (I’m white and she is black) and she has expressed concern about how her mom would act towards me. She definitely has low self esteem and I believe abandonment issues and that’s why me leaving for Miami triggered her so much. All her past boyfriends have been terrible to her. The first one cheated on her, the second one was physically abusive and almost killed her, and I’m not sure what this last one did. I know I’m taking a huge risk of getting my heart broken again, but I love her and I just keep in mind that she probably does love me but is very damaged at the moment so anything can happen. We even got matching tattoos with our initials while we were not “official” which was her idea. I know, it’s crazy lol. It’s just so sad that she is this way because she is absolutely beautiful (she models on the side) and is funny too. What type of issues do you guys think she is dealing with and what caused them? How can I help?"
"Hardly any friends, but depression and anxiety have tired me out too much to do anything about it.","So I have GAD, some depression, I’ve been told I probably have avoidant personality disorder, ocd, and maybe adhd. Because of all this, my body is just...exhausted. I need more friends, as I feel isolated and lonely, but the thought of having to go out and socialize makes me feel exhausted. Like, too much effort, and probably nothing good to come of it, because I’m so terrible at maintaining conversation and socializing. But the thought of being alone for longer makes my anxiety and depression worse. 

Also, it’s worth noting that I’m on cipralex and Wellbutrin, but wondering if wellbutrin is helping. I don’t know if I’m still depressed. I’m not unbearably sad, I can’t cry, and I just sometimes feel...underwhelmed by my surroundings. I also see a therapist. 

I don’t know how to get over this. Is it normal to be emotionally and socially exhausted if you’re on meds for depression and anxiety? I don’t know what’s normal."
I'm not okay today,"I'm at my breaking point pretending that I'm fine with everything going on in my life. Last summer, I got divorced from my husband and had to move back home with nothing but my 2 children to take care of. It took me a long time just to get an on call job that I do love doing, but I make little money, my paycheck varies, and I need a lot more money to pay for things for my growing children in the long run, let alone try to move out into my own place anytime soon. My ex-husband is getting married to the woman he fell in love with when we were still married and left me alone in the hospital for right after I gave birth to our second child. It hasn't even been a full year since we officially got divorced. At work, they had a full time position available for the exact job I'm on call for. I reached out to apply for the position, and although I know not to assume I'd get the position, I didn't even get a response from my boss acknowledging my interest. I understand that they probably want someone new or with different qualifications for the position, but I'm feeling really insecure about how well I'm doing. Even though everyone at work, from co-workers to guests we serve tell me how they all enjoy my work efforts and ethic when I'm there, I can't help feeling like I must be doing a terrible job to where my boss doesn't even give me the time of day to give me a call or anything to not just give me an interview, but to acknowledge that she received my interest but is looking elsewhere.

I'm sorry I'm babbling. I'm just at my wit's end. I don't have anyone to really talk with about my problems. And I'm really feeling in my emotions right now. I don't know how to deal with all the rejection. I feel pretty worthless and insignificant in all aspects of my life, like no one wants me or cares, besides my kids. And although I love my kids to death, I don't want to live just for them. I want to have my own life. And it sucks that in my own life, it's seemingly going nowhere."

Extremely introverted at home?,"To the extent where it's causing friction between family members.

I'm not proud of that and I know that I can't use my mental health as an excuse, but I often feel like such a freak for being introverted as I feel like as an adult , I'm expected to go about my day chatting to different people and making small talk, and sometimes I like that but most of the time, I am the kind of person that closes the door on any kind of optional conversation because it just generates too much anxiety.

What are the most basic things one should do to feel good?,"I'm not asking from a mental health perspective necessarily, just from a healthy perspective, but it can apply to mental health too.

What are the most basic important things one should incorporate into their daily schedule to feel good and healthy? For instance, I wake up at approximately the same time daily, I sleep at approximately the same time, I always do my hair, dress nicely, do my make up, eat certain healthy foods, etc.

I want to work on making some kind of schedule where healthy behaviors become natural. I sit around at home way too much and I want to change that."
It's terribly hard. Facing your negative beliefs is not as easy as I thought it would be.,"It's been seven hours since I took my papers and pen and sat down to fill in the thought diary form. 

I have studied it, it's a great way to get over negative core beliefs by logically rationalising them. My doctor wants me to be getting better with this. 

But it's hard. I've only written a couple of lines. I don't know how I'm going to manage this month.

Anyone take meds that give you tinnitus?,What causes this and does it go away? Every single type of meds does this to me.
I found this on Twitter and I would like to read your opinions.,"""Hey mental health twitter, I'm about to really piss you off: If you have a mental health episode, you still owe the people you exploded on an apology. You still did it! It's not their job to roll over and let you treat them however you want :)""

Looking for positive content,"Hello, I’m trying to beat depression and I need your suggestions!

I feel like myself only when tired,"I've been tired for so long that whenever I get a good night sleep, I don't feel like myself. I feel like an empty shell when my mind is fully awake.

It started when I went to university. I'm a night owl and my typical sleep schedule is going to bed at 3 am and waking up at 10 am which sucks when you have to wake up at 6 am everyday. Going to sleep at 10 pm everyday meant that I just rolled around in my bed for 5 hours before I finally fell asleep, doesn't matter how much melatonin I overdosed on, can't fall asleep.

Sleeping for 1-3 hours a night was first tough and I spend all my days (except the weekend) dead tired, and then I got used to it. Being tired no longer felt awful, it became the new norm.

Now I'm honestly scared. It feels like the only way for me to feel true happiness and sadnesss is when my brain is tired so it's forced to release those chemicals to keep me awake"
"I know running won't solve my problems, but I can't stand to stay in one place any longer.","Not too long ago I saw a post on here from someone that was planning to kill themselves, and instead decided to pack up and leave town instead, citing if they were going to give it all up they had nothing to really lose anyways. 

I feel similar. I haven't ever planned on taking my own life, but I do have horrible anxiety, issues with control and letting go, and suicidal ideations. I've found a job that lets me work remotely so I've decided to leave. I'm not sure where yet, but I need a death in a different way so I can start over from the traumatic few years I've had. 

I'm so tired of feeling this way and while I know running won't solve all of my problems, staying on the hamster wheel in the same city, same friends, same relationships won't do anything for me either."
i finally talked about my problems to my partner,"i've been having a hard time lately. since a week or so before my partner's suicide attempt. i have not felt comfortable talking to her about my problems since her attempt. i told her about my feelings that night. later, she was in the hospital. it wasn't because of me and i know it wasn't. but i think my brain made that connection subconsciously. i haven't felt comfortable with anyone else knowing my problems, either. either because i don't trust them enough or because i don't think it would help to talk to them. but two days ago i was able to open up to my partner. i feel a lot better. she reassured me about a lot of things. she's the first person i've told (besides reddit) about my returning self harm urges. i am very glad that i was able to tell her that. i love her so, so much and i'm so glad she's here for me. i'm not sure what i would do without her."
too scared to tell my parents about my mental health,"in the past they said i was pretending to be suicidal for attention.

eventually i told my doctor who told me to see a psychiatrist, but my parents said it wasn't a big deal so they never took me.

now for the past month my mental state has been at its worst. i want help and this is probably the last time i'm going to try and ask for it.

i guess i'm so scared because if this doesn't go well i'm going to end up killing myself because there's no other way out of this. and as much as i want to do that i'm terrified to do it if that makes sense.

does anyone have any advice on how to approach my parents? please don't suggest school counselor because that did not work out for me in the past my school's counseling services are bad."
Don't let abusers convince you that violence against you is necessary.,
"Literally just yesterday, I started hearing songs in regular everyday background noise.","I'm not sure if that makes sense but whenever there is a constant background noise it sounds like a song. It happens when I am waking up too. So, like, this morning when I was showering and the bathroom fan was going it was playing a quiet live version of Casey Jones. Right now, the kitchen fan is going and there's some rock song I don't know...maybe its something I'm coming up with or maybe its a song that I just forgot I knew. Ironically (or maybe fittingly), Mac Miller's Self Care was playing when I was waking up.

I love music but am not super into specific types, I would never ask the music snob's famous ""have you even heard of them"" type question because I know my answer is almost always ""no."" When someone asks me what type of music I'm into the answer is ""any kind!""  It's so weird too because it is accompanied with a weird buzzing.

I've been having extremely bad anxiety and have just recently gone through some pretty traumatic stuff. Additionally, have struggled with addiction but have been sober for some time now. Oh, also, I'm in isolation a LOT and feel like I have no one and am terrified of that. Maybe that's all what sparked this? I'm just worried something in my head just snapped.

I apologize if this doesn't fit into this sub, I don't post often and have never really gotten the hang of it. Let me know if I should remove this, or, the regs might I guess!"
Help with being too negative.,"Hi.

Feeling Detached??,"Hey guys, this is something I’ve been struggling with for some time now. It’s hard for me to become close to people, even my own family. It just feels like it’s really only me doing this life thing solo. I meet people but they all just seem like the same personality with a different face. It’s hard for me to get interested in people for long, and even if I do find myself becoming interested in them, I find I suddenly become emotionally attached very quickly and imagining the best things between us happening. But nevertheless when our relationship ends I find it’s very easy for me to move on, almost like I never really cared about them in the first place. If anyone else is having/had a similar experience feel free to share, or if there is communities where there are others who feel the way I do feel free to let me know. Thanx!"
I am more than a murderer’s daughter (trigger warning),"
TRIGGER WARNING: Survivors of murder-suicide

In 2018 I became a survivor of murder-suicide.

Facts were written in the media, case files, autopsy reports and death certificates. They were illustrated with crime scene photos and national news headlines.

Breadcrumbs of truth built the narrative for me, never telling the full story.

There are 11 murder-suicides each week in the United States, often in military and veteran communities. Why aren’t we talking about this publicly beyond sensationalized headlines that don’t help solve the problem?

The lack of support, information, and humanization led me to believe nobody *should* be talking about it. I felt voiceless and carried significant guilt and shame because of the stigmatized circumstances.

I’m taking back the narrative. As a survivor of murder-suicide, I am more than a murderer’s daughter.

I will add to the national conversation on mental health and veteran post-traumatic stress disorder. I hope my story will educate the public and help survivors of this type of tragedy to know they are not alone; the shame is not theirs to carry as they navigate their complex journey.

If you are a survivor of murder-suicide, or know somebody who is looking for support, please connect with me here on reddit. I am connecting with researchers and fellow survivors to reduce the stigma on this awful experience, and help other survivors. I am committed to taking my experience and turning it into a force for good to help others."

The new thoughts without my will pop up, in a second and I do not know what I am thinking at that second. I know that getting relief from these thoughts without my will that help me not obey the compulsion, are still ocd and I should not fall in the trap.

Anxiety over Coronavirus,I’m experiencing quite a lot of anxiety over the new disease that has emerged. I’m terrified that it’s going to be some apocalyptic epidemic. I know it’s probably an overreaction but it’s making me really unhappy at the moment. Can anyone reassure me? :(
I can feel myself going down again,"So poor mental health has been a part of my life for a very long time. Im usually able to control it with small acts of self care, or the support of those around me.
I'm recently a dad, which is amazing in itself. I cannot express the love i have for a person I have known for mere weeks.
But; that doesn't mean I'm not struggling. I've got very used to being able to have time to myself. Ive used alcohol and drugs in the past as a release from my thoughts. Now my life is to support this vulnerable human. I cannot plan a sesh or spontaneously go out for coffee. I love them. But I cannot do right in my partners eyes. She's tells me every attempt to look after the baby is wrong. I'm drained and I wish I wasn't

**NO SELFIES. THIS WILL RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE BAN. NO PERSONAL INFO. INSTANT BAN.**

Tis simple. No photos of faces that are identifiable. This includes faces with pets. Selfie bans are in our opinion for your own safety. I also recommend you delete all photos of your face in relation to our sub. You can keep them up if you want, I think you should delete. Plenty of people get doxxed on reddit from various places. I am not a fan of putting our users at risk in that way. Do whatever you want other places, but not here. It also takes away from users that need help.

NEW ACCT RULES

We have instituted a 30 day new account review for all new accounts. This is to protect our user base from banned users. We have been harassed and brigaded. I wont go into the specifics, but this is necessary to keep the community safe.

What this means: All posts and comments go through our mod queue. We approve them as appropriate at a human rate.

Please do not message us from new accounts asking to approve your posts. We are doing that as fast as we can.

If you want to become an approved user prior to 30 days, we need you to message us from the account you would like to use and then your alt account which we will review. If you have zero history and no alt account, then all posts will be reviewed until your account is at least 30 days old. Basically, you need an acct with reasonable positive or neutral history.

"I was able to share my feelings with a brand new therapist, one who is awesome and actually asks questions.","I cried in front of a therapist for the first time in my life. I’ve been doing therapy for 20-22 years I think, since I was about 10 years old. I was able to share my darkest feeling, that because I’ve had zero friends for most of my life, and that I haven’t been on a date in ten years, that it shows that I have absolutely zero value as a human being. No one sees any worth in me. It fucking hurts so bad. But since I was able to show vulnerability in front of another person, I have been on an upswing for the past week without even trying to be happy. It just magically raised my happiness level. And I’m back to joking around with people for now. I think I like this new therapist and I hope this feeling continues. Wish me luck."

I was supposed to be walking by now had the surgery gone normally.

And I'm on nasty pain meds like Fentanyl patch, 30mg Oxycodone every 3 hrs, and those just bring my pain down to a 6-7 *when resting*. I'm having severe tachycardia from the pain, monitoring with EKGs and this box hooked up to my chest with tubes. I just now got my catheter out and can only use a bedpan. All other meds didn't remotely touch my pain and I worry they will think I'm a druggie.

I am hardly sleeping and getting intensely depressed. Anxiety through the roof. Found out my MIL has dementia and she now cannot live on her own and is going to a NURSING  HOME. 

Everything seems to be falling apart and I'm so scared. I keep throwing up from the stress, so much that I had to be placed on IV solution  because my pee went dark and very dehydrated.

Be careful with Caffeine!,"Last month (December) I was very depressed, I started using caffeine pills, wich was bad because it turned my depressive episode into a mixed manic episode. And it didn't end well.

Before that I also used to take a lot of coffee wich also resulted in mood changes and made me more unstable in general.

Since I have stopped with caffeine (for the most part), I have been feeling better and less mood swings.

Please be careful with caffeine! It did impact my bipolar A LOT!"

Back on meds after experiment without,"37 M. A few months ago I went off a couple meds (Wellbutrin and Klonopin) because I wanted to see what it was like. I'd been medicated almost since I was diagnosed at 24 and am really stable with a good support system, job, family, the works. What I didn't realize is the amount of media out there that is anti medication and I ate it all up hoping that I was that same dude who shaped up his habits and diet and just willed his way through mental illness. Turns out, I need my meds or my brain goes into self destruct mode with a large side of anxiety. I crashed hard after a few months and am now about 9 days back on meds and I feel so much better. My therapist is tough and said that she admired the weight loss, exercise, and personal discipline but it's not enough to beat a chemical imbalance. So I guess my point in writing this is don't suck up this anti medication bull, they're always trying to sell you a new superfoods powder or supplement along the way. If you need your meds, it's okay. Just feel lucky you have access to them and imagine what it's like for those who need them but can't get them. They're my vitamins and with them I'm a really successful and happy person and without them, I lose all sense of worth or hope. Do I like taking four medications a day, not really, but now I really really know that I need them. Peace all. Love you."

Am I bipolar or am I misdiagnosed?,"Hello, I'm a 20 year old male and I have a lot to unload here. Obligatory mobile warning so I apologize for formatting issues. 

I'm currently very concerned I have the wrong diagnoses. I was abused by my mother for a very long time, kicked out, had to drop out of high school, house hop, and I've lost tons of friends and jobs along the way. 

In that period of time I was 16-18 and I abused alcohol and occasionally random drugs. I was diagnosed bipolar 2, with major depressive disorder, and OCD behavior. 

I couldn't keep a job for the life of me, I just made bad impulsive decisions often but looking back at the last year or two I've done fairly well with maybe one or more instance of leaving a job spontaneously with no back up plan. My current job I've been at for about 7 months and I like it. 

I'm extremely concerned because this is the first time I am alone. My gf of 4 years and I just split up, and now I need to be the breadwinner, and save up money, and buy a car, and find a new place to live WHILE dealing with mental health. 

I have been tracking my mood for two days now and I've gone off medication my doctor prescribed for bipolar. I believe the prozac I was on was increasing my anxiety and paranoia tenfold and now I'm waiting for the half life to get out of my system. 


Here's the issue though. No anti psychotic has ever had a good effect on me, I've tried several, most anti depressants do not work on me, or I get so in my head the side effects become number one. And I look back and I do have mood swings, I have made impulsive decisions, and etc. But I have never had a manic episode. No not needing to sleep, no feelings of intense euphoria, no confidence. Just intense anxiety, paranoia, doom, dreading the future, and having the urge to run away from responsibilities. 

My family has a huge history of mental health and I'm not going into it right now because I'm a different person and it doesn't seem too relevant. 

Do you all think I'm struggling with something else and my misdiagnoses is correct? I want to get help, find the right meds. But it doesn't sit right with me whatsoever that I may be bipolar, from everything I've read and seen I don't even think I fit bipolar 2 like what I'm diagnosed as because my 'highs' are more like terrifying lows and my lows are just depression spells. 

Please for the love of god someone read this and tell me what they think. 

Thanks everyone! 

TLDR: Not sure I'm bipolar and no meds currently have a good effect on me,currently in a terrible state of anxiety, slight confusion, slightly agitated, and uncomfortable, dreading the future, suicidal. Curious to see what this might be instead or if I need to honestly buckle down and consider I am bipolar."

"Is anyone else ""bipolarsexual""?","I call it ""bipolarsexual"", definition: sexuality changing based on whether one is manic or depressed. I don't know if I coined the term or not.  For example, I identify as asexual when depressed, but allosexual (definition: not asexual) and bisexual when neutral, hypomanic, or manic.

Does anyone else have similar experiences?"
Seein’ and hearin’ stuff.,"I feel like I’m stable (I’m well aware that I’m not the best judge of that) however: whenever I’m trying to sleep it’s like there is a TV on in the other room. BUT. I LIVE ALONE AND DONT OWN A TV. I just want to sleep like a normal human being and when I brought up hearing things to my doc he COMPLETELY DISREGARDED ME. Tonight, tonight was fun because I’m driving home, on the highway, all alone and boom. Bright moving lights in the field off the road. I’m no doctor but I know that isn’t normal, and it’s making me so mad because I can’t afford to miss work to go to the hospital if this progresses which it probably will because I lost my health insurance, my doctor doesn’t think I’m valid and ugh. I don’t want to feel broken anymore. I just want to sleep."
Looking for advice for my GF,"Hi everyone - I am very new to all of this, but I’m hoping folks here might be able to help me figure out how to help my girlfriend. I could elaborate in MUCH longer, greater detail, but to try to cut to the chase I’m basically going to say that she seems to have bipolar II. She has struggled for years with depression and anxiety/panic issues (since before me) and in the last few months, after having to give up her therapist (a psychologist) due to a change in health insurance, she decided to try out a psychiatrist. The therapist had never diagnosed her, but the psychiatrist basically met with her once, wroter her a prescription for something and the prescription said bipolar II on it, so we’re grappling with how we should react to that right now - if anyone has any thoughts on this, for starters, would be glad to discuss.

BUT the thing I’m writing about first and foremost is that I’m wondering if anyone has any ideas advice on getting her a therapist when it seems to be a real struggle - her health insurance provider is a small one because she works for a small company (a small law firm) and it seems not many therapists take her insurance. Of those that do, she hasn’t managed to find a single one who is taking on new patients, and she says the OOP for therapists outside her insurance network coverage would be $150/appointment.

Has anyone else been in this situation? Are there alternatives that I don’t know about? 

I think it’s desperately important that she be talking to a professional, and that it be a pyschologist, as it seems the psychiatrist is basically a scrip-writer. She needs a professional who can get to know her and help her work through things, as well as (I think) learn different kinds of mental tools or leverage different kinds of resources to deal with how she feels and how her mind reacts to certain predictable stresses. I don’t know the first thing about this stuff, but I imagine that kind of thing would HAVE to be a key plank of the support she needs...

All help would be deeply appreciated. I’m a noob here guys and just trying to figure out how to help her..."
"This coronavirus shit is scary, and as someone with bipolar it’s not good for the mood swings.",Anyone else? I’m rapid cycling like crazy because of this crap.
IN a bad place,"I’m not sure if this forum is an art gallery for people with bipolar or a support forum so here goes. I’ve fucking had it with my life, my moods my misdiagnosis and with people who say they care but only on their terms. I wish my moods came when it was convenient for them. People are fickle and offer help to make them feel good about themselves. How long do I have to last with this mind of mind. I can’t take it much longer. I want love and care and affection and I offer it back in droves but it’s too much for everyone. It’s like there is not enough time to receive love but definitely time to binge watch the whole 8 series of game of thrones. I have a whole I’m my heart I can’t fill and I try so hard but I have no one besides my parents which is a plus but I’m not a 14 year old child. Can I not be loved by someone who hasn’t given me birth?? People live with domestic abuse, rape but you mention bipolar or addiction and they run like your Jeffrey Dahmer! My psychiatrist says I’m bipolar and never even listened to my previous diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. Now my therapist is adamant I have borderline and NOT bipolar. The prognosis is different. In the middle is me. A drug addict and I’ve relapsed a few times in the last few weeks after three years. I can’t piece my life together anymore and feel more alone in my soul than ever before. I’ve been take benzos day and night and I might as well be taking candy because I get nothing out of them. I feel I’m the worst friend - the one you can’t enjoy but instead have to take care of. Like the drunk friend at the end of the night (only at least he was fun until then). I bring my parents disappointment and stress. I have immense capacity to be successful but that is not what I want most in my life. I just want to be stable for at least 6 months in the last 40 years. Is it that much to ask?? I can’t hack it anymore and checking out always seems too painful and selfish and hurtful to my parents - everyone can go fuck themselves. I’m at a dead end."
Lamictal and Sex Drive (Positives?),"After starting Lamictal, still on a low dose, my sex drive has increased tremendously? I’ve seen posts saying it’s effected people’s sex drives super negatively, but I want to know if anyone else saw an increase in sex drive. Maybe it’s just a sign of hypomania though."
"I found an old journal I used and found a weird poem-like paragraph. This was an extremely dark time when I first discovered I had PTSD from sexual trauma, it was my first date with someone in high school and when we decided to ‘go further’ I felt as if my world was collapsing. I wrote this.",
How do people get anything done without energy from hypomania/mania???,"Not sure if this is actually triggering for mania, but I labeled it as such just incase. 

How the hell does anyone keep anything clean, organized, or otherwise put together without an extra boost of energy? Seriously, I'm not depressed right now, I'm actually stable, but I just don't have any energy for anything besides work, cooking and going to bed.  My home is steadily becoming a mess since my last hypomanic boost, and I long for the ability to get my shit together again. I have a sleep disorder that keeps my energy levels lower than most, even with treatment. So for me, having hypomania gives me the ability to do things that normal people have the ability to get done on a regular basis without feeling mania/hypomania. Sure, I don't like the anger or the instability of mania/hypomania, and the psychosis sucks. I just want to hit that sweet spot again where I feel good and my shit is clean and organized.

No advice needed, I just hope to find someone who can relate to feeling the monotony of stability, and a longing for the feeling of mania."
My brain and body not communicating... Don't understand what is happening.,"My body is very tired, because I have not been sleeping the last couple days. Yet my brain keeps giving signals that I have enough energy to stay awake, resulting me not being able to sleep.

I can only sleep when I do so much stuff on a day when I am literally THAT broke that I am about to faint.

What could this be?"
Really struggling tonight,"First time poster, long time lurker. Also on mobile soooo sorry for any strange formatting. I've really been struggling with my mental health this weekend.  I spent the weekend with my boyfriend which has kept my mind off of things.

Today was different. He hasn't initiated any dirty of physical touch (kissing, hand holding, etc.) which hurts. When I reach out to initiate, he pulls away.  It's pushed me into a cycle of negative thoughts including but not limited to: he hates me and/or he's going to dump me.

The pain im causing myself from the thoughts is easily reduced by self harm. I've been really good for a long time (8+ months without incident), but recently I can't help myself. Usually it's a small area,  but tonight the emotional pain was a lot.  I feel hopeless and desperately alone, even though my boyfriend is sound asleep next to me. 

I'm not sure what I'm expecting from posting this, but I needed to get it off my chest."
anyone wanna talk about their life or problems im very easy to speak with + bipolar among other things,"as title says willing to talk to anyone via mic i can give disc in message just not in here due to rules unload on me maybe i can help , maybe not. But i will try."
"Oh, how I hate you, bipolar","So I need some ideas of what makes you guys feel better.

My girlfriend broke up with me out of nowhere due to bipolar related actions that happened last year. I don’t blame her for it to be honest. But I’m feeling super shitty. I have zero motivation to do any of my hobbies and so, for example, my big reef tank (pride and joy) is suffering. 

I need some help with adjusting to the change and some suggestions of things to get out of a crappy mindset. All in all, I think I just want to vibe from you guys as you can relate to the whole bipolar situation. My friends and family don’t really understand."
am i crazy? tree branches said LAX FALL ECL yesterday and I knew I needed to stop something then Kobe Bryant’s helicopter crashed. Today it said “HAYLEY” and it’s all connected. please help I don’t know if I’m going insane or I need to do something i’ve predicted things before I’m so scared,

Mixed episode / hypo crash feelings"

Worried about not being taken seriously when seeking help,"So recently I've been thinking about dying an awful lot. It's got to the point where I'm afraid that I might do something dumb.

I want to seek help, because at least today I dont want to die so much, but here's the problem. I live in the UK, and I'd still be under CAMHS (child and adolescent mental health services).

I have no history of suicide attempts, nor self harm ( because I'm a coward) and I wouldn't be able to see a doctor for ages, even if I could get my parents to believe me.

When I was twelve, I started to get paranoid that there was a girl from my school who lived in my attic and my parents didn't like me because they were focused on her. I wanted to murder her. In retrospect, this was probably my first manic episode. I was so damn scared and I worked up the courage to tell my parents.

They laughed at me. They laughed at me. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to kill myself but it seems like the easiest way out if I do it properly. That sounds awful written down. I can't stand the idea of being hospitalized but it's a constant driver behind my desire to die and do it properly.

I don't know who to turn to. Its preventive, me reaching out, but my parents won't give me the time of day when it comes to my health and doctors won't take me seriously without an attempt or self harm, and that whole fear in itself pushes me right back to the original idea of suicide. Not only is it the easy way out but I just can't stomach this anymore.

I don't know what to do. I'm scared. I don't really know what I want people to say to this in all honesty. I just want to know I'm not alone, I guess?"
ANYONE TRYNA JUST TALK ABOUT THEIR LIFE ?,anyone tryna get on the mic and talk dont be shy im an icebreaker. I cant post disc link due to rules but just message let chat.  If ur deppresed bipolar sad or whatever lets talk about it lets help each other .
"Did you start smoking marijuana young? If so, do you think it surfaced your bipolar disorder?","I started when I was 15/16. Smoked maybe a couple times a month and then when I went to college (18, and especially 19-20 ) I smoked a lot. I was diagnosed when I was 21 and I often wonder if weed triggered my bipolar disorder or if it would've revealed itself anyway.

It is universal that smoking pot when you're in the development stage 15-25 is bad for your brain, so I'd like to hear other people's stories on their young marijuana usage and whether or not they think it brought to the surface their diagnosis.

This post is not meant to be a debate on whether or not marijuana is a good treatment option for bipolar disorder. There have been a lot of other posts for that and people seem to be split on pro/con and have a variety of personal experiences."
How do you manage to work an 8-9 hour work day?,"I’m diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and ADHD. I take 20mg of Latuda, 20mg of fluoxetine, .5mg benztropine twice a day(to help with the akathisia from the Latuda) and 40mg of Vyvanse. Even with all of this I have a really hard time going to work and staying at work. I just get so depressed in my down states that I just feel like I can’t do it. It doesn’t help that I only kind of like my job and my manager doesn’t understand at all. But how do you all manage working for 8-9 hours a day?"

My mother is bipolar and dosent know that I know,"I dont know if its okay to ask about advice on here, so Im sorry if its not, just take it down or let me know. 

I dont have a good relationship with my mother, its everything from horrible to kinda ok at times, and I just resently learned from my aunt, her sister, that my mom is bipolar. This is something she has kept from everone, neither me, my father or siblings had any idea, despite her siblings having her put at different institutions when she was perticularly bad, the last time when i was around 15. As far ar I know, she takes no medication, dosent talk to anyone, and just ignores the whole diagnosis. Anyways, I have tried to google a lot about bipolar disorder after hearing this, but there are a few things I ccouldnt figgure out, and I'm hoping you guys might be able to help me. I can remember multiple episodes from my childhood where she has acted unusuall and scared me, in hindsight I figure she must have been in a ""high"" or something, but whenever I've tried to talk to her about it after the fact, either to ask what happpened or to tell her that she really scared me she always say that I'm making it up. Even if there were more people there who all can back up my story she says we are just all trying to make her look crazy. Is this normal, does she actually not remember the situations, or is this more of her just not wanting to aknowledge it, and has nothing to do with her being bipolar?

I'm sorry this is a bit of a long post, I'm trying to figure out what kind of relationship I can have with her, but I really need to know about a few of these instances, and there is no way I dare ask her, as she doesn't even know that I know. Thank you so much for reading it all."
attempting eating disorder recovery and ECT simultaneously. while also in grad school. and also completely manic right now and going through ativan and lithium withdrawal cold turkey also with other med adjustments.,"...how the actual fuck am i doing this? i know logically it’s a lot but i feel and am so capable.

i’m spinning and spiraling but i want to get better, i want to recover."
Lamicital 100mg recall,"I receive a notice from my pharmacy 2 weeks after the recall of my medication was started. It is the exact. When I read the letter I was freaking about but calmed myself down with help of my family. It somehow in production got mixed with a low dose of Enalapril Maleat which is a heart and blood pressure medication. I’ve been taking this drug since the summer time. Coincidentally that is the same time that the it has begun to be accidents mixed with the other medication. It said to stop taking if I have any odd side effects and call my doctor. However, every medication that I have ever taken has given me side effects since I’m bipolar 1."
"My partner is wildly un-opinionated about literally everything, almost to a fault, and I don't always feel comfortable talking to him about my mwntal health or bp because it makes me feel like I'm faking it because I'm so functional. He encourages me to take my meds and drives me to appoints, but...","I feel like I can't talk to him about bipolar? He met me after my diagnosis so it's just always been a thing with me, but as more things progress in my life I only feel supported in a very material way. Same with my parents when I was younger and feeling horrible things the strongest. If I remember correctly my dad called my first psych 'a quack' which at the time was said in anger in the midst of other issues.

I'm about to start IOP next week, and partner is super supportive and excited for my opportunity, but I get this gut feeling and I can't talk to him about it. I had a bad reaction to an SSRI and physically couldn't sleep for two days which led to hallucinations but I never felt like I could ask to go to a hospital. I would bring it up (cost is not the problem because I get like 10 days in a hospital on my plan for $0) and it was received as being sort of dramatic and something that could be worked through. But I have felt weird since then and just stopped that med at the instruction of my doctor and sweat it out for 48 hours.  It was horrible and I regret doing that to my brain outside a medical setting it was like a bad trip I wasn't prepared for and didn't ask for.

Now I'm vaguely depressed but not suicidal and I think part of the problem is that my partner HATES when I feel bad. He almost minimizes it because he wishes it were not as bad, and it makes *him* feel so bad he doesn't know what to do so he blocks it out like he would try to if he felt that bad himself. That sounds like a gross behavior but it comes more from empathy than apathy.

Have you ever felt this? I'm sure my description makes him sound like garbage but that's not what I'm trying to get across. He is a worrier but never goes to the doctor for anything and just rides it out if it isn't bleeding so he has no concept of hospitalization outside like... Me cutting myself so badly I can't survive or something don't know.

It just sucks feeling like I need to go to a NAMI meeting so I'm VaLiDaTeD or something."
Does anyone else use the hospital as a 'safe place'?,"I just got out of the hospital, currently hypomanic and psychotic. I already feel like I need to be back in the hospital. I feel like I shouldn't have gotten discharged. I only feel alive when I'm in hospitals. I use the hospital as a sort of safe place, where I can actually talk about my problems and stuff. My life outside of the hospital is awful. I'm used to the scheduling of hospitals and the structure.

Does anyone else relate?"
Miscarriage:(,"I just suffered from a first trimester miscarriage with a baby that I didn't even know I was pregnant with. Trying to balance overwhelming feelings of guilt and grief. Definitely trying to not let it trigger a full blown depressive episode, but idk what to do ya know?"
I think melatonin did wonders.,I slept very good! I would recommend it to try it.
"Went back on my meds, feeling better again.","I'm guilty of not wanting to take my meds for the rest of my life. Luckily it's just Wellbutrin and Lamotrigine, both once a day. 

I was going through a depressive cycle and it was about to ruin an important friendship. I luckily recognized my signs and symptoms that I've had many times before. And the rough patch between my friend and I is now behind us. It was emotional time, crying left and right. Being unproductive, and also just trouble getting motivated. I managed to get my grad school apps in time even tho I was struggling. 

Today was a better day, cleaned the kitchen, did the dishes, went to work, went grocery shopping. About to clean the fridge and liter box.

"Hey guys, I'm not bipolar myself, but I was put on a Abilify recently after being switched over from seroquel, I know I'm not bipolar but I was hoping I could get some advice from some of you guys as there doesn't seem to be another appropriate sub for this","Long-story short I have OCD coupled with suicidal idealisation, I was on prozac and Seroquel up until a few days ago, now my psychiatrist has cut off my prozac to prepare for switching over to Venlafaxine, and he put me on Abilify, and although this morning was my first dose on Abilify and off Seroquel, I feel really awful, I feel really sad for the first time in years, I've gone from pretty energetic to completely and totally sapped, all I can think about is that I've wasted my life and that others, particularly fictitious characters had achieved so much more than me by now, I was on 500mg of Seroquel for years and that always hit like a truck when I took it, but it wore off after a few hours and it didn't leave me completely hopeless...

Help me figure out what happened?,"Trigger warning: Psychotic episode
Trigger warning: SH and suicide
And trigger warning of general bad bipolar and schizoaffective behaviour.

I kind of feel like I'm going crazy, but not the type of crazy I thought I was.

Yesterday me and my husband had an argument that turned into a shouting match. When he left the room I started screaming ""F*ck you"" over and over again until I got up and shouted about leaving. I was hysterical of course. I grabbed the flashlight because it was dark and went to put my shoes on when I saw him coming and tried to slide the door shut.
He's stronger than me so he won and I turned and went to continue leaving but he went to hold me or something and I screamed. Full panic shrill scream, hands over my ears.
I probably stopped because he backed off and I think that maybe he went to go grab his phone so I opened the door and left.

I dont think I was going very fast mind you because I remember looking back at our driveway and him not being there. So there I am bare foot and no light, hysterical and shivering. I'm kind of thankful that the road is so long between the house and the first country road because it gave me time to feel scared about going out into traffic.

He caught up and started running because I got close and that was pretty much the end of it. He talked to me and we walked back. I lay down on the couch sort of numb and things seem normal today.

But don't you think that's kind of weird? Did this actually happen? If it did, why didn't my husband call someone? The cops or a hospital or crisis services? Today he's reacting to me getting closed off like he always does. He's not being any more gentle or supportive and is just making the same old empty promises that he usually does. What happened last night has never happened before, not even close I feel.

So was I delusional instead of hysterical?

I've read so many of peoples stories of going into that kind of hysteria and their loved ones call someone or make emergency solutions for their partner. I'm so confused and I'd love your advice or experiences. Thank you."

Drinking and recreation on medication,"Hi guys,

I’ve been on Lamictal and paroxat for a year. Throughout the year I went to one party and had a few too many drinks but I was all good. 

The interesting thing is that being back to how I used to be sort of is quite an enjoyment in itself. I don’t really feel like doing anything.

I was wondering what kind of effect if any would engaging in recreational activities do like alcohol, medicinal marijuana, mdma, Molly and yada yada. 

Would be nice to hear of some experiences.

Asking for research.

Thanks,"
What to do during hypomania or rapid cycling?,"I don't know what to do. Not even an hour ago, I was anxious, jittery, and had racing thoughts and now I feel the need to burst into tears. Is it rapid cycling or actually hypomania? Any advice?"
How the hell am I supposed to feel on meds?,"I was diagnosed 6m ago and been trying to figure out meds since (fucking sucks). I feel a bit traumatized from the cycling the meds have caused and a bit broken. Im trying a new combo again and just don’t know what I am supposed to feel like when they work?

"How Were You Diagnosed, and For What Episode?","How did your doctor diagnose you -- through a clinical diagnostic interview, or a structural clinical interview (for DSM-5), or some other way? Which kind of doctor diagnosed you? How long did diagnosis take; the individual interviews, or the whole process? What kind of questions did they ask?

And, if you don't mind sharing, what was the episode that got you diagnosed, or the general behaviors that rang alarms?

I'm realizing my first diagnosis was slapped onto me by a doctor in the hospital who barely saw me for 30 total minutes over my 2 week stint. I've kinda just gone along with it, but i want a proper, structured diagnostic test that determines if I am bipolar and how far along I might be on the spectrum, once and for all."

A little scared to be diagnosed,"Hi, im a 25 yr old guy who has a good life. Okay job, free time, money to pay bills. Mentally? Ive had manic episodes so bad i go non verbal and shut down for hours. Depressive episodes that have ended in suicide attempts. My old therapist said i might have ""manic depression""  before it was more widely studied and i havent been back in years. Bipolar disorder runs in my family for the few that have been diagnosed. Im really scared to have that label on my back. I dont want people seeing everything i do thats not 100% happy and friendly to be part of the disorder. I dont want my emotions and concerns trivialized. I'm a large fairly fit black man with long hair, and a big beard. People dont take me seriously when i try to talk about emotions, they think its a joke or when i show my emotions they consider it ""TOO EXTREME"" like i cant express them. This would just add fuel to the fire. I don't want to go back to a therapist but i feel i have to. I don't know what to do. Im losing my mind and i just want a little peace again."

Not sure if this is the right place but I’ve been following the sub almost religiously. Anyway I’m currently coming out of a manic episode which sunk into deep depression lasting nearly two years.

I found a track that I thought summed me up, and interpreted it as a constant change of mood, from one extreme to the other. It’s not really uplifting so maybe give it a miss if you’re down the rabbit hole atm. There’s nothing really down there but despair, if so keep fighting you magnificent bastards!

Stability,"So I've been pretty stable on meds these past couple months. Like, my Daylio graph has been totally in the neutral range the past 2 months.

This has got me feeling like ""how can I actually be bipolar if I'm so stable right now"". I've also been feeling like I was actually faking my bipolar disorder, but I know it's not true. 

I've done this before last spring and actually did stop taking meds. I was fine for a couple months then started rapidly cycling which caused me to decide to get back on meds.

So, my question is, how do you stop yourself from having these thought or having the urge to stop your meds? Am I just gonna struggle with this for the rest of my life???"
Vraylar + Wellbutrin combo? Or something similar?,"Hi everybody. I had a 2nd failed attempt with abilify. I have an appointment tomorrow with my psychiatrist and I know she’s gonna bring up Vraylar and Wellbutrin as a combo for bipolar depression. She brought this up last visit before I insisted on trying abilify again. She didn’t want to try rexulti when I asked. I wouldnt dare take Wellbutrin on its own due to my past experience with it. I have tried Vraylar recently and thankfully my insurance will cover it. I stopped it unfortunately because at 3mg it gave me extreme fatigue and tiredness. This time, I’m gonna stay at 1.5mg and time it so when the fatigue kicks in, it’ll be bedtime. So I’m willing to try a low dose Vraylar and low dose Wellbutrin combo for now and take it from there. SSRIs are just awful for me except Effexor. Does anybody have experience with this combo or a similar combo??? I’d appreciate hearing from you!!

Eating and episodes,"In my worst episode to date, the way I viewed food changed a lot more than usual. The same thing is happening to me right now, and I’m wondering if anyone feels the same way. 

Eating while manic vs. depressed, the changes are different. Sometimes I eat a lot when depressed. But sometimes, like now, when it’s getting really bad... I *can’t* eat. My body hurts and longs for food, I’m shaky and dizzy and feel like fucking shit. But I cannot for the life of me bring myself to eat. My experience of “desire” in any form is completely obliterated. I will stand in the kitchen looking at food for an hour paralyzed by indecision, because nothing seems even remotely doable to me. No matter how little effort it would take to prepare... like even things that would take 0 preparation seem totally unfeasible and impossible to me. 

“Nothing sounds good” is a gross understatement. I feel literally *repulsed* and completely overwhelmed by the idea of eating, to the point that I am literally unable to. Even if I feel like I’m actually dying. So that’s soooo fucking fun. Wondering if anyone else has ever experienced this or if it’s just me. Sigh. I just want to cry."

i’m so alone right now. i moved states for college, but i haven’t been able to find a lot of people who i particularly enjoy hanging out with. i lost my friends in my own town after an ugly breakup with my ex, who raped and harassed me and then played the victim card because i left him and came out as lesbian. 

i’ve not cut or binge-purged in two years. and i feel like i’m about to finally lose it. self harm was an addiction, and i can feel it starting to creep on to me again. before i got clean, i used to be a total mess. this was before i got therapy & help, i used to rely on my best friend for emotional support way more than i should’ve. truth be told, i needed a first responder because i would spiral a lot, and there just wasn’t anybody - which isn’t their fault, it’s mine for needing people so much, but it’s still isolating. 

now that i do have been through a year of therapy, it’s impossible for me to expect help and support from my family or friends, which is progress. but it also means that i’m completely alone in this. my family doesn’t ‘get’ BD. the few friends i do have honestly don’t really care, even though i wish they did, but it’s not their job to. i’m incapable of being alone with my thoughts. 

every day i have recurring flashbacks and PTS episodes from previous experiences with DV and sexual assault. i have nobody to talk to, nobody who can just listen, and living with the weight of it all is suffocating me. i haven’t been able to talk to anybody in my life about the things i’ve experienced. most people know a few things, but none of the really bad stuff. i’m trying to move on so hard but it just feels like i’m going backwards. i’m so alone and i needed to just talk about it somewhere, absolutely anywhere. hence, this post."
Triggers,"I'm laying in bed scrolling through photos from the past five years, organizing them into albums, sharing some with family members, smiling at the memories.

Suddenly, I start to cry.  Nothing major, just a few tears.  But the idea of getting out of bed is so overwhelming.  Not even for coffee, and I love coffee.

Anyone else have good memories trigger depression?"
Was she ever even real?,"Three years ago I was in a relationship with this wonderful girl that just understood me in a way no one else did. She was perfect for me. We were together for two months. And then she broke up with me and moved across the country. 

I can't find her. She's not on facebook, I don't have her number anymore because my phone reset itself, and I lost all my pictures of her in that same phone reset. I've reached out to people I thought she knew and I'm finding out these people have no idea who I'm talking about. People I thought she knew didn't know about her. 

I never met her friends. We only went out once or twice, neither of us liked going out and preferred to remain in and watch Netflix. We would just stay in my apartment, get high, and watch anime. I never went to her place either because she had four roommates whose names I can't remember.

I'm losing my fucking mind. Did I delude myself into thinking that I had a girlfriend for months? Can't be, right? That's just too fucking insane. Or am I deluding myself into believing she existed? I think she did, I want to believe she did, but I can't find her. I. Can't. Find. Her. What the fuck is going on? 

Has anything like this happened before? Am I crazy? Do I need to be hospitalized? Please, someone just tell me I'm okay. I need to believe I'm okay. Because if I'm not then I don't even want to think about it."
Anyone with intense spiritual vision while manic?,"The shit I see man xD

Reached complete emptiness in meditation. Saw the aura of an angel on a hill, had demon take over mind and phone (yeeeaaah... crazy one). 

Man, if only I can just live with it and control it. Life could be so much more."
Significant increase in pain after med changes,"I have both fibromyalgia and arthritis. I have had quite a few changes in medications so far this month for both epilepsy and bipolar. I have experienced a significant increase in pain over the past few days. Note that the most recent med change was the removal of tegretol and increase in lamictal. I was wondering if this is normal and if anyone else has experienced issues like this. Here is the list of med changes I've experienced this month. 

 1. removal of geodon  
 2. removal of buspar  
 3. 1 day trial of latuda  
 4. 1 day trial of abilify  
 5. removal of trileptal  
 6. adding tegretol  
 7. 2 dose changes of lamictal, weeks apart  
 8. increase and then removal of tegretol

Could ADHD meds be exacerbating “bipolar” symptoms?,"
Does any of this sound familiar? Seeing psych on Tuesday to discuss a bipolar diagnosis. I have ADHD, only diagnosed last year. 

I know I’ve always felt there were two sides to me. An energetic one and a depressed one but I thought everyone felt like that. 

About 6 years ago, after a serious breakup, that distinction became very prominent. I started fluoxetine for depression and that helped the low mood but since then I would cycle every 4-8 weeks between happy and very sad. I just thought that was life and got on with it.

8 months ago I started Vyvance for ADHD and that didn’t seem to impact my mood in any way. It’s brilliant for my ADHD. It quietens my mind and I actually take it to sleep at night.

However, over the last month I’ve experienced very contrasting moods and I don’t know why they are more acute than normal:

For 14 days I was hyper:

-	unusual confidence 
-	4 hours sleep max
-	full of energy and ideas 
-	spending much higher than normal
-	spring cleaned house
-	higher sex drive 
-	a bunch of weird decisions (buying steroids etc)
-	I overcommit and then “depressed me” as to deliver.


Then 10 days ago (and counting...):

-	Mood dropped like a stone in one day. Very depressed. (Trigger was a relative being taken to hospital).
-	No energy at all. Literally. Need 16 hours sleep and still painfully tired. 
-	thought about suicide 
-	can’t think coherently 
-	became highly introverted. 
-	My tastes change. I stop liking things I love.  
-	Food craving has gone.
-	Right now I can take a dozen caffeine tablets and not feel anything. When I’m hyper one caffeine tablet is enough to make my heart palpitate."

Cheating on vraylar,Anyone else out there feel like they want to cheat on vraylar? It’s the weirdest feeling. Every time I try this med I think of cheating on my wife. Not that I would do it. It’s just thoughts. Anyone else?

How did you know that you were bipolar?,"20M here. Never been in a relationship. Always been the quiet, slightly overweight, introverted kid with few friends. Kinda built a persona around me thats awesome, open, friendly, great to hang out with, perfect drinking companion, definitely-won’t-have-problems-with-relationships-type (& getting laid) in the last couple of years. Yet I don’t even know anymore who that person actually is. 

Lately I’ve been feeling very strange. I can’t concentrate a lot, having an enormous amount of “ups” and “downs” through the day. This leads to me either drinking alone, getting high, smoking, taking more (smaller) risks and generally behaving self-destructive. I’ve somewhat been able to get hold of those substances, at least to some degree. 

Yet I feel like I’m in a downward spiral. Somehow I managed to pass my exams this semester so far, but I feel like this won’t be for much longer. I hate the ups, because I know that the downs will be much worse. I’ve already discussed this all with my therapist and lately I’ve come to the conclusion that absolutely no person I’ve met in these past three years or so, since I built this awesome guy around me, actually knows the real me. The guy who hs very little experience with girls, yet claims to have slept with 20 at least. The guy who claims to become the next Steve Jobs, yet fails to even go to the gym, because of how shitty he feels all the time.  My therapist only asked if I considered meds, but didn’t further elaborate. I brought up a few times that I think I might have bipolar, yet I quickly turned my prompt idea around by telling him that therapy might work as well. Lately I’m not so sure about that statement...

Sometimes I wish this mess in my head just ended. With those few people, that actually know the real me, I speak freely about ending it all. Maybe I won’t even have to do much, as I always go a step further when taking the substances I mentioned earlier. 

So, I’m a mess. I think I have bipolar. What would you suggest?

However, the main question I meant to ask, how did YOU know that you were bipolar?"
"mania, no meds, paranoia, anxiety???","This is extremely unorganized and I'm sorry; I am waiting to hear back from my doctor, so I've reached out to her and my therapist. My main thing here is, with people who have experienced full mania or something, I know paranoia and things are a symptom, so I don't know if anyone has experienced similar. 

So I've been really anxious and low-key paranoid for a while, cut out a few friends for a while because I was convinced they hated me and were lying to me, until they found a way to track me down, etc., so I had a med adjustments, queue my problems with my insurance company not wanting to pay, so I'm off my meds. I've never been off meds so I was like hey this will be fine! 

But now I'm not entirely sure what's going, like I've been having a hard time keeping grounded completely but this weekend has been hell. I didn't sleep well because I spent all of last night crying in a corner in my bed texting my friend because I was so scared something was going to get me and that I was in a nightmare, things were moving in the corners of my eyes, and everything I tried to do made it worse. I was convinced my cat was some sort of skin walker creature and that my parents weren't my parents so I couldn't ask for help. It took me over an hour to get out of my corner to the edge of my bed so I could even go to the bathroom. I was also convinced that if I fell asleep if turn into a mannequin and get stuck there forever. My dreams when I do sleep say that they're the real ones. But ofc that's what it feels like here. 

It's better now that it's day time and I kind of feel ridiculous, but I still have this sense of I'm scared a bit or this isn't reality necessarily. And even when my anxiety was really bad, I was just jumpy, not ever quite this level of anything. I'm shaky and out of breath and my legs are weak, but I'm wide awake and kind of feel like I can do anything still. 

I don't know if this could be a meds thing or a mania thing, or maybe just really bad anxiety; I have been sort of fluctuating mood wise, admittedly I did stupid things involving caffeine, and kind of want to go back and do it again, knowing that it wouldn't be super great. But a coffee would be great right now, even though I haven't eaten or drank anything today. There's a lot going on in my head and in general and I would maybe like to know if I can label this, even if I can't control it. It's a mixed bubble of I want to do things but also I can't get out of bed because I can't really trust what's going on."
This sub is as lame as this illness,"Sick of scrolling through your little paintings, cookies and other images which do nothing but glamorize this illness. This is no place for discussing what it actually means living with bipolar. Do not feel represented at all by most of what happens here."
The point,"Anyone else wonder the point of being here? I'm miserable and make my husband miserable and dont ever want to make my daughter miserable.



I've already had my meds upped, and I'll see my psych later this week too.



I've lost my purpose. Quit an accounting job to go part time and have time with my daughter and horse. I took a part time job which I quit after 2 days bc it worked Saturdays (didnt know this until the interview).


I'm so sad and miserable. I've been like this for weeks. I can't find my purpose. I want to just do nothing.


Im seriously considering asking for electro shock therapy to feel better."
Veteran bipolar fighters assemble.,"Hi guys,

I'm 20 y/o and got diagnosed with bipolar and BPD in November last year. I'm a fricking bipolar baby. My whole life now makes sense buuuut I find it hard to realise when I'm really manic until I get to where I am now; Finding it hard to crawl out my bed and trying to pretend to my boyfriend that I'm keeping myself together when living is seeming less and less appealling. As the days go on I'm finding it hard to find purpose to go on and I'm really praying I become manic again just so I find the will to live. 

I'm on 50mg of Quetiapine and 25mg of Prozac. I'm up for a medical review on the 29th where they'll probably fuck with my tablets to sort out the imbalances I'm experiencing. 

However, aside from the meds I really just want to figure out the best tips on being a stable, normal human. I want to be able to work without being star of the show for half a year and then making a fucking fool of myself when I can no longer perform. Then my paranoia comes along. Then the existential misery that everything is pointless. Then the want to even live diminishes and I'm literally a husk of the person I was. How do I stop it? Nothing seems to help. It's draining for me but mostly for those around me. I hate how it effects those around me. I hate it so much. 

I just wanna be in the middle. No grandiose ideas and mad plans about shit that at the time is so achievable but is impossible for someone like me.  I'm sick of it. Honestly, I really am. 

Those who have battled this absolute mental shit show for longer than I, how the fuck are you all doing so well and actually living with this? I honestly cannot fathom it. I'm genuinely considering packing my shit up and disappearing forever because this shit is unbearable."
I cried at work,I cried a few times this morning for no reason and I thought I had calmed down by the time I had to go to work. I was avoiding talking to anyone because I still felt down. I work retail and my manager asked me to go around and hand out shopping bags and greet customers and I said “can someone else please do it” and then I bursted into tears. I’m so embarrassed about it. Some of my coworkers saw and I had to walk past a bunch of customers to go to the back room to calm down. I think I’ve been having a mixed episode this week but today I’ve just been crying and depressed out of nowhere. I took Xanax before I went into work and I had told my manager I felt like it was affecting me and that I was very tired and not feeling well after taking it. They let me go home but I feel guilty because I only finished an hour of my five hour shift today. I work after the store is closed tomorrow night but I’m just embarrassed about today still and I’m not sure why I’ve so depressed out of nowhere.
do u guys feel like everyone hates u at times?,"is this a bipolar thing or does everyone just hate me?

(In need of advice) Bipolar 2 and dating someone who is Bipolar 1,"Backstory: Me and my SO have been dating for a little over 8 months. I am Bipolar 2, and she is Bipolar 1. I had never really known the differences between the two until our relationship, so I thought that we could be great for each other. I thought we might be more understanding with each other when it comes to having Bipolar. And, at first, we were. We fell in love with each other in a way neither of us had experienced before. It just clicked. We’ve lived with each other for the majority of our relationship and do everything together. Vacations, work, we even merged together our friend groups. 

The thing is, we’re both non medicated, and she loves to go out drinking all the time with me and her friends. She tends to become manic during our nights out, and will often become verbally and physically abusive (sometimes will even break up with me) up until she sobers up, and into the next day. Then, it’ll die down and she will feel awful about herself. She has history of cheating on me, but I decided that I would rather work on open communication and trust instead of calling it quits, unlike in passed relationships of mine.

Fast forward to the present: I just got sent home from Army basic training early (the military doesn’t allow bipolar soldiers, what a shocker) and was super excited to see her, and talk to her for the first time in a month. Turns out, she had went through a major depressive phase when I left. She had spammed me every day, up until the last week I was there about how she was missing me and felt empty without me being there. She had been in contact with my mom frequently, which was abnormal for her. And she would text my friends about me constantly. But her last message to me was a random breakup message, completely out of the blue. It was like a switch was flipped, and she blocked me on most social media. She keeps just saying “she feels different now,” but I have a decent feeling she’s going through a major manic episode. She’s drank every night for the passed week, spending the night at places more often than being home, neglecting her college classes, and not going to work at all. She says that she’s “happy with how her life is” and then an hour later will text me about how she feels unstable. Even her friends and mom tried to talk her out of dumping me. For someone with more depressive symptoms, this is really hard to accept. I blame myself for leaving her, because this wouldn’t have happened if I hadn’t have gone to boot camp, right? I just want to help her through whatever it is she’s going through, but she won’t let me hardly even speak to her. I went over to her house last night because she had sent me that “I miss you, come over” text. But she feels off now, like she’s going through something she refuses to acknowledge. 99% of the time our relationship is great and we can talk through any problems, it’s mainly when one of us is having a really bad episode that it starts to turn bad.

I’m in need of some advice here. It’s hard for me to give up, knowing that it could all be just an episode that will come to pass."
Diagnosed BP2 17 years ago and it ended my aviation career. So I bought a couple of tools and a book...,
Anybody else experience increased appetite/weight gain on Latuda?,I was on Trintellix for a few months and had no appetite whatsoever. Now I’m weaning off Trintellix and have started Latuda and I’m eating like a horse. Anybody else experience this? I’m hoping it goes away because I’ve struggled with being overweight for years and had finally been losing. I’ve already gained about 4-5 lbs from my norm since starting a few days ago. I reaaaally don’t want to be on a med that makes me gain weight. I know it sounds silly but if it doesn’t go away I would probably rather switch meds. I don’t want more problems that come with obesity ya know :/
Has anyone here developed tardive dyskinesia from the meds? Because I have it and it makes me want to die.,"I can't control random movements on the left side of my body. I can't use my left hand. I can't sit down. I can't travel. I can't go to a restaurant.

I just got diagnosed and I've found that this condition is irreversible and permanent, and taking meds will only continue to make it worse.

If you have it too, PLEASE shed some insight on what the hell is going on and how I can improve my symptoms."
I’m by far most creative while manic,"But nothing ever gets finished. I’m a guitarist and I’ll have this flood of riff ideas. Generally don’t even try to play them and forget before next meetup. If I do remember I either write a whole song in 30 minutes and everyone else is playing catch-up or...

I just play the same thing over and over. I get lost in the groove. Then it’s all blank. I can’t make anything work with it. Then I forget what I JUST PLAYED, then I start something new and it’s either got potential or is GARBAGE.

Think I remember that good one. Rhythm is off. Can make it sound like it did at first. But with this different timing it’s easier to go into another riff. Then...”I got nothin, let’s do an older one.” The. I forget how that goes too. 

Then I listen to the recording while I smoke a cig outside. Back in 5 mins. Maybe a beer run. Then I forget it again. Then, and ONLY THEN, do we have a damn near perfect take. But I forget how it ends. It’s ok, other dude did too because it keeps changing. Then I listen to the recording, over and over until next practice. 

Then I get there. Blank slate. “I had this idea for a riff while I was on my way, lemme figure it out real quick.”

Rinse, repeat."
"Same drug, same dose, different pill, feeling terrible","Hi, happy Sunday, friends. 

I’ve been on 200mg of Lamictal/lamotrigine for the last few months. Had to increase a teeny bit from 150 over the summer so my doc prescribed some 25mg pills. I increased the dose again in the fall. 

So now I am taking 200mg but it’s one 150 and two 25s. Obviously one month of thirty 25s is not enough, so I asked my doc to increase the number of pills. She (logically) asked if I should just take a 200mg pill, but I have like... 3 months of 150s bc of my 3 month meds delivery. So, no. 

So then she prescribed a 100mg pill and told me to cut it in half. It’s definitely a different manufacturer, and I’m having trouble evenly cutting (yes, even with the cutter)

The day I started on the ‘new’ dose I dropped into a depressive state (that was Wednesday). My sleep quality went from 90% to 60%, I’ve gotten really sluggish and nauseous (was home sick from work Thursday), and have had three separate panic/crying attacks in public (during things that are supposed to be fun, like improv practice and workout class) 

Is this normal? Should I ask to go back to my original script or just try and stick it out? Has this happened to anyone else? 

I was mostly stable and actually getting good sleep and feeling less stressed and then this fucking happened. I’m so mad. (And sad... ugh)"
Anyone else have a problem with self-sabotaging behaviors?,"I can’t help but procrastinate every single task. I eat like shit. Always sabotage myself romantically, etc.

It’s gotten to the point where I feel completely insane because I recognize that these behaviors are bad but do nothing to change. I’m really afraid that I’ve lost control of my life and can’t change at this point. It sucks. I’m internally panicking but outwardly being complacent. I really don’t know what is wrong with me but I need to find a way to fix this.

Has anyone experienced anything similar?"
"Help. Not sure if potentially bipolar or not. I have my psychologist and psychiatrist appointments set up but it's in March, so I need some opinions and advice now","Hi. I don't know how to start so I'll start by saying thanks for reading and trying to help. I'll appreciate anything.

I've been depressed since I can remember - 12 years old or so. Finally I decided to look for help in February last year and I got a psychologist appointment. Was diagnosed with depression. Thought that was all there is. But therapy never helped. So in September last year I got medication - combination of mirtazapin & escitalopram. Thought it helped but I guess it didn't.

For the past month I've been crazy. I've gone to drink anytime someone asked me to go with them (never did that before, I'm a hardcore introvert and need to know my plans at least a week in advance) and I've always overdone it. I don't know when I have enough and that's with everything - alcohol, cigarettes (only a party smoker), hookah. I always overdo it.

I thought it was just me finding a group of great friends who like to party and finally enjoying life thanks to my medication. But my friends that I've known for a longer period of time told me that they don't like the way I'm behaving, that I'm weird, different and impulsive, and they are worried about me. I got mad at them for ruining my happiness, thought they are just annoying because they are more introverted than I am and just don't understand it. Even though I was aware I'm overdoing alcohol, I just thought that it's because I've never had so much fun in my life. I've been different but to make one thing clear - I never crossed my boundaries. I'm not much of a conflict person, I never argued with anybody who told me I'm behaving strange, I've never slept with anyone and stuff like that, during the potential hypomanic episode.

Also I've always been a B student, but now I can't even focus on my exams. I failed one already and haven't studied for another one I'm having tomorrow. And the worst thing is that it doesn't feel like procrastination, because I'm not even stressed. I just don't care about it at all.

Today I woke up and realised how different I've been for the past month. I called my psychiatrist to ask if she has some earlier empty spot for me and she said she's full until March but asked what's up and I told her. She told me it sounds like bipolar II but not to jump to conclusions and we'll talk about it during our session. She'll let me know if someone cancels their appointment and will put me there. 

Can someone here give me their opinion? I keep telling myself that I'm making it up, it's just that I found fun friends and am enjoying the bits of happiness that my depression wasn't able to take away from me... I've struggled enough with my depression and I don't want to be diagnosed with another illness, but at the same time I feel like a hypocrite because now I keep telling everyone that my psychiatrist told me I might be bipolar. It's like I don't want it and I hate myself for it but I want everyone to know.... help, please?"

Full on manic mode,"I feel like I'm ruining my own life right now and I can't stop myself. I recognize that I'm in a manic episode, yet I can't resist my impulsive behavior.  I work 1000 miles away from home (oilfield life), my grandmother is dying and going into hospice care, I've stopped talking to nearly everyone that is not a coworker and my mother. I've asked/demanded a divorce from my husband of 9 years because I'm tired of being married to someone who doesn't seem to care about how I feel. I've started talking to a coworker and getting *very* close to him, and I know he's just another impulsive decision. My friendship with him is jeopardizing the future of my job, but I also don't want to be without him because he understands me and for the first time in my life, I don't feel like he's just tolerating my existence.

I talked to my pdoc about Ativan because it was helping me at night at least for a couple of hours, but she took that away from me. 

Now I am panicking constantly all day and through the night, barely sleeping and barely eating.... and most of us know what happens when we can’t get enough sleep.

BUT, I work in the tax field (full time) and am entering my second semester of college (full time).

I feel like it carried me through all of the things that I needed to do at work and outside of work.

I’m afraid that I may not be able to handle everything as well as I did when the mania was there to help and have been considering going off my pills.

I've been out of work since November and I finally go back on Monday. It was a really hard pill to swallow considering I had just started in September but my job has been nothing but supportive. It doesn't hurt that we have excellent mental health coverage. It's been a wild ride between impulsively getting a dog (best impulse decision ever), going inpatient, and now participating in an intensive outpatient program. All my meds have been changed and they really seem to be working for me (trileptal, zoloft and abilify). I finally feel hopeful for the first time in a while. Just a reminder to myself that nothing stays bad forever. Wish me luck guys!"
Man smoking up a day dream...,
Did you tell your teachers you have bipolar disorder? If yes how did they react? Did other students know about it?,(in high school)
How do I stop over sharing at family gatherings? Do you guys have any tips on how to read your audience? What can I say comes to trying to tell the truth when they ask how are you?,"Im about to head over to my boyfriends family’s place and I’m a wreck about what to say because i haven’t seen them in a while.

I really don’t want them to think Im crazy but I feel like they wouldn’t understand if they ask how I am and I just said

“Well i have good days and bad days”

What can I say that will keep the conversation light while still explaining that I’m stuck in the biggest blackest hole and i have been trying desperately for years to get out of.

P.s. this forum has been such a great help for me in terms of creating a routine every day and how important sleep is!!"
How often do you guys get high?,"I get high almost everyday, sometimes I feel its the only thing that helps. I worry I get high too much, especially because it makes me hallucinate. 

Would love to read your experiences"

Recently diagnosed bipolar 1,"Hi everyone,

Background: years ago was diagnosed C-PTSD from severe childhood abuse, GAD & MDD. A few days ago the major depressive disorder diagnosis  was dropped & bipolar 1 took its place.

Idk what to feel right now.. I’m happy I was diagnosed b/c it explains so much & makes me hopeful that I can actually get help & live a healthy & happy life.. but I’m also angry that it went undiagnosed for so long & I have fucked up a lot of great opportunities, relationships, & friendships. Also being told that I HAVE to be medicated for the rest of my life now is like ... wtf! Especially the financial burden that it’s going to bring.

I always knew something was wrong. But psychiatrists and therapists always assured me the severe depression was a symptom of my ptsd and nothing more.. I believe in the past, I had hypomanic episodes so that went unnoticed as I always chalked it up to me just “ getting better” but it wasn’t until last year that I 100% had full blown mania and then a few months ago it happened again ( almost exactly a year later) except this last time it was SO BAD! .. I won’t go into the embarrassing details of what happened but let’s just say it was complete textbook minus any hallucinations both visual & auditory..

I didn’t seek help during the manic episode b/c to be honest I was loving it! I knew something was terribly wrong but I felt so confident, I had the energy to hit the gym everyday so my physical appearance actually did change for the better, I didn’t have a care in the world so a lot of positive things were happening cuz I was just going for it all.. but due to lack of impulse control.. I’m sure u can imagine I made a lot of really bad risky decisions.. it was so much fun tho.. until it just wasn’t.. like getting fired from my job for the first time in my life :/

Then one day I just woke up with absolutely no energy, barely could get out of bed and just felt blah.. this went on for months.. I refused to go back to therapy because I knew they’d want me to see the psychiatrist for anti depressants again but I have NEVER tolerated those well. 

Those meds always made me psychotic and obsessed with suicide.  And horrible physical symptoms even when I would “ give it time” and I’d stay on them for weeks & then months, Just to be switched to another anti depressant and have the same psychotic reactions with more physical symptoms..


I was never given any answers from the professionals.. Just that my reactions to the meds were because of my chemical makeup that would make me react badly to SSRI so they would try diff antidepressants.. but they always made things worse 

I was tired of the professionals not caring about my well being and caring more about the commission they were making from prescribing me meds so I refused to take them.. 

So I sucked it up and tried to tough it out with this past depression. But it became debilitating b/c it had been the worst I have ever experienced so I had no choice but to make an appointment.. 
I couldn’t get in for weeks.. and while I waited for that appointment I could feel that familiar surge of energy coming back.

I went into my appointment to talk about how depressed iv been for the past months but without realizing it I was in a complete mixed state & it must have been pretty obvious to them because the therapist stopped mid session with me and ran into the psychiatrists office to tell her she had to see me ASAP ( talk about making u feel like a piece of shit)

After meeting with the psychiatrist I had no choice but to come clean about the manic episode I had recently & what’s been going on lately and she explained that I deff have bipolar 1 and that would explain why I always reacted the way I did to the medications I was prescribed in the past..

I got a script for 50mg seroquel for a week and then it’ll increase to 100mg and they also want to put me on abilify soon.. I’m terrified of medication and I don’t want to be on any.. but she said iv been “rapid cycling” so I need meds to stabilize me and then will till continue to take meds for the rest of my life :/ 

So far the seroquel takes about an hour or two to make me sleepy & I actually get rest.. but for like 12-14 hours!! I’m just barely making it to my new job on time and not able to shower or eat or do anything b/c All I’m doing is sleeping and then work.. repeat.

If ur still reading this still.. thank you, I know his post is long. I just don’t have anyone to talk to.. I just feel so many emotions right now. I’m so scared to be on meds.. but they both kept assuring me these types of meds will help and all the ones I had been on in the past made things worse because I’m bipolar and ppl who are bi polar can’t tolerate anti depressants / SSRI ??

Idk I just feel so alone in this. I’m in a shitty marriage and want to move out but it’ll be awhile cuz $, I have no friends, no family in the area and not close with family even if they were close.  I don’t feel suicidal but I do feel hopeless. Like pity party thinking of “ I’ll never be genuinely happy, sex won’t ever seem fun or worth chasing like it did while manic, who would even want to date me when I’m ready to date again”


Any advice would be greatly appreciated, it’s almost 3am and I’m wide awake and feel so restless. Hopefully the seroquel will kick in soon"
My life is burned to ash,"So I kind of knew I was probably bipolar since around 5-6 years ago while I was still in college. I refused treatment both due to stigma from my family, and me knowing it will be a chronic life sentence.

Well, I went through several mania and depressive phrases since the , most were just embarrassing but did little actually damage to my overall life.

I tried everything to take my illness under control, (was also struggling with severe anxiety, which I manage to get over after becoming apathetic to life). Meditation, hiking, read ALL kinds of spiritual text, even went to the occult.

Things went extremely down hill when I met a fellow mystic who encouraged my delusions of grandeur and psychosis. I was a retard for listening, but was desperate and broken at the time since my dog(my sole friend, 15yrs) was dying and my mind was snapping already.

Yet during my 3 months of mania I manage to land my dream job, 6figures, freedom, autonomy, etc. etc. despite having a shabby work record due well... untreated bipolar. During the last month I went completely psychotic, thought I was communicating with a demon (who knows probably, that fucker had a mind of its own.) who lead me to do things to stabotage my life further and further.

I threatened my company, my peers, and cursed parent to be eaten by demons. Mother got a stroke during this period so hey, black magic may have something to it after all huh? Well now I’m back living with them, they same ppl I blame for the trauma they caused me.

Diagnosed with bipolar, borderline and a doses of ptsd. 

Career burned to ash, so a very dark side of myself, and can’t look at any form of entertainment without flashbacks as I literally merged with everything while in my psychosis (details hard to explain,my own little magical practice. It works, but I was a little too crazy to control it).

Want to die very badly, but lack guts to do it. I don’t know where to pull the strength to keep going, in the past it was my own personal philosophy I developed, but after this I don’t believe in anything anymore.

God has a sense of humor. Was blessed with luck, but cursed with insanity."
What are YOUR coping mechanisms for dealing with major depression?,"Soon I will fall into a depression again, as I suspect I am lightly hypomanic right now.

For me it is sometimes hard to cope with the depression."
Waited all week to post this.,
Just a drunk rambling post about how my doc owes me one,"Kind of just want to record my thoughts 

So last year I was inpatient for maybe a month. I was a normal kid, on clonazepam, pregabalin and seroquel I think that’s it. Quit seroquel CT and they took away my gabbies when I got there so I started feeling like shit despite the 10 meds they added on. They pretty much made me beg for my pregab back and wrote down drug seeking behaviour when I finally did, after they offered me a significantly higher dose of clon. Hahahaha fuck

They cut me off that too, and it’s taken a year + alcoholism to get off the meds. I quit everything like weed/vaping/alcohol but I had a drink tonight. I’m just too tired, my anxiety keeps me up and away from school, work and my friends. I’m going to ask the doc to hit me back with some relief. I still suffer pretty bad from agoraphobia and panic attacks

 I don’t necessarily need benzos, here’s my list. I’m not coming back empty handed again, I need one of these to hold me over until I can switch docs

(1) benzodiazepines
(2) antipsych like buspirone
(3) hydroxyzine
(4) pregabalin
(5) citalopram
(6) something like depakote or carbamazepine

Maybe I’m not being realistic, maybe I’m just fed up and in denial, I’ll figure it all out later"
Bipolar and relationships,I’ve always thought that no one can love me. But it just hit me more that if it weren’t for my fucking bipolar disorder and depression then maybe I can be. Not to say that people who have them are unlovable. Mentally ill people are just as important and worthy of love. Personally I don’t think that applies to me. I just want to be normal. I’m scared to let someone in. I always think they’re better off without me. Why choose a fucked up person like me when there are so many who are normal. Why be with someone who need extra help when there are those who are much easier to handle. I wish I can talk to people about bipolar disorder in real life. I need someone close to me who can relate. I need someone who is patient but honestly I’m not worth being patient for.
Are there any bipolar meetups in the salt lake City area?,"I've looked online and there's not much information I can find. If anyone knows of one or some sort of support group I think it'd be good, I'm pretty active in this subreddit but it'd be nice to get some irl support group."
"I haven't done anything creative for so long and the picture isn't dovish yet, but this is how my mind feels must of the time.",

When hypo-manic,
"A song that I think many of us can relate to. Warning: language, anti-religion",
One of the hardest parts of mania is realizing that there's a different side of life that is less depressing than your regular existence,"Dont get me wrong it's not like mania is good, but the feeling of depression lifting and then losing that is soul crushing."
"I'm in the midst of a manic episode (I have literally slept and 2 hours in the past 2 days, brain won't shutup) and I have been absolutely obsessing over this drawing. It's finally finished. I call it Dread",
How do you switch your meds from night to morning doses?,"I take lamictal (50mg) at night, and I get these weird energy boosts about 30-45 minutes after. Obviously not good if I am trying to get to bed.

How would I go about taking it in the morning? I was told I have to take it at the same time every day, and I don’t want to mess with the dosage too much."
Anyone else take dissolving Zyprexa? I love it! Very helpful for mania,
How did you feel when you were first diagnosed ?,"Hey,

I just wanted to know how you guys felt when you were first diagnosed ? I am asking because I went to the doctor just before Christmas right in the middle of one of my depressive periods, told him my symptoms and he reckoned I was probably bi-polar and referred my on to mental health.

But finding this out has sent me into a proper tailspin, I thought I had my moods sort of under control and kinda knew when I was due an episode. ( its pretty much every 4 months I get a really bad depresson) But my moods have been really up and down like crazy every few days. I don't even know if this makes sense to anyone, Did/does anyone else get this ?"
Mothers,"So my mother has caused me a lot of pain due to her neglect. She doesn't mean it she just doesn't pay attention or make very sound decisions. 
Question is im having my first child and Im not sure how involved I want her to be. She wants to live with us but im not sure if it's positive on the child's development."
My girlfriend suffers from Bipolar disorder any tips?,She’s now in a depressive state (although she won’t admit it) after just coming out of a manic state. She just sleeps and occasionally eats. I tried to get her to bathe but she won’t. She seemed fine for a few days after being manic but she had an argument with a family member and has been in a depressive state since. I’m not sure if the this state was triggered by the argument or just the effect of mania.

Anybody on topamax only and doing good?,"So my dr first gave me depakote and told me it doesn’t make me gain weight as Zoloft or lithium. But it actually caused me insane weight gained in one month. 
So now he switch to topamax. But he also prescribe me guanfacine together. But after I google about guanfacine, it also cause weight gain. 
I know I should be asking my dr but he is impossible to reach out. He is at office only on sat and the office don’t pick up phone on Saturday. So I am still hesitating to take guanfacine with topamax. I just only took topamax today. I wonder if anyone dose take only topamax and doing ok with it."
"I recently decided I would share my poems with you guys, the ones that are related to my experience with bipolar. I hope some you can relate. ❤",
Does anyone else having laughing/crying fits?,"I get these fits of laughter that just happen out of nowhere. Sometimes they are in response to something that is actually funny, but I can't stop laughing for maybe 10 or 15 minutes. It just goes on and on... and sometimes it ends up with me crying too. So I'll cry and laugh hysterically on the floor or ground or wherever I happen to be for like 15 minutes and then suddenly it's over. I can't figure out if it's part of my bipolar or schizophrenia."
is it possible for me to (22fbipolar2) have a healthy relationship?,"Ahh im broken over someone who left me while i was having a depressive episode after a stable whole six months i felt so alone and uneasy 

and then i met some girl who wants to have a chance with me i feel like she’s genuine and all but i dont wanna be left alone again i dont wanna go through the same things over and over 

im barely overcoming the hate i have for myself for ruining every relationship after six months of stability 

i really dont know what to do"
Anxiety from NOT Doing Things?,"So, I had a hypomanic episode from Jan 8 to Jan 18 that had hyperfocus/productivity, decreased sleep, increased energy, and increased sociability. I crashed (sleeping 12 hours, 2 days in a row) thought I was done with it, but my psychologist says I've been having other manic symptoms; me, I just don't feel it, because it's without the energy. Or so I thought. 

Does anyone get anxiety from NOT doing things? I got into Panera to do work, and wanted to do anything but work. It felt like the cells inside my body couldn't sit still. And I immediately got a load of anxiety. It takes watching a bit of a movie to calm me down to work.

In the middle of working, I suddenly think about taking a local bus to somewhere, I don't know where would be a good idea. I don't do it, but it's attractive to me. But, I know I must do my work. But I know I missed out. Some anxiety ensues. 

In the car, when my mom picks me up (which was why going on a local bus somewhere I don't know wouldn't make sense and could be alarming) and we drive, a song comes on and it feels like the world's clicking into place, I almost feel a high from it, if I knew what being high was like. It felt so good just driving, listening, I was 'feeling' the song, shit was playing like a movie for me! I wish I could go dancing to it, do something grander with it, just do something grander. Then, I feel a lot of nervous energy. 

Does anyone else experience this? 

I'm confused, because yesterday morning I was out at 6:50AM, going on to myself about how lovely the weather and sunrises are, and hadn't noticed I'd spent an hour walking or my hands were freezing cold. This afternoon, I had a rage tantrum in front of my mother over some misplaced deodorant. And, I keep getting this anxiety stuff -- meanwhile, during that song, it felt like all was right with the world, as if world peace was accomplished. I'm just trying to make sense of it all here."
Does CBD help with bipolar (1) symptoms?,
Went to a party... asked a guy i like something embarrassing (mixed episode),"Very first time i talked to him. and ofc i’m manic so i was like whatever. i asked if he meant to match with me on tinder, and he told me he doesn’t even have one. i thought we matched, but then after i went home i realized we didn’t. he lives in the same building as me. maybe he’s into me tho? possibility? 

summary: i ruin a lot"
Shallow was one of my favorite songs and now it’s a trigger,"“In all the good times I find myself longing for change, in all the bad times I fear myself”

“Aren’t you tired trying to fill that void?”

“Or do you need more, is there something that you’re searching for?”

Now that I’ve gotten this far I guess it might just be the whole movie that triggers these thoughts and feelings. Always remember us this way gets me too. If I kill myself today that’s how I’ll be remembered if I’m remembered at all. I feel 100 years old and I’m just so tired. 

If there’s one thing that I appreciate it’s that this sub has always been here for me, and has always been solid even when I’m fighting everything in my life. I love you guys"
"I can’t break out of this depression/I don’t belong here/I’m a failure at everything cycle. Help. How do you break out of this? I’m medicated, life is even going well....I just hate myself. So much.",
How do you know when you need help?,"How do you know if you need help vs. riding it out? I have been on a really good streak for a year now after 7 years of roller coasters, I went back to my p talk last week because I noticed I was having more depressing thoughts, and having the need to work harder than usual to not spiral. So my doctor change my antidepressant, FYI I was very non-compliant on the previous one. This is day three and I can't tell if mania is starting to rear its ugly head or I'm just going to be grouchy mood.  See my son who's 17 and also BP has been a major pain in the ass the past 2 weeks so thats stressful.  I'm so confused on whether dealing with him is the straw that it's going to break the camel's back or if it's something that I can get through and next week or so it'll all be fine.

But guys it's like a physical FEELING, do you know what I mean? I can just FEEL it. And that makes me very scared. I don't know what to do. The logical side of me is reminding myself that life is always stressful and this doesn't happen. And the whole reason I went to my doctor last week was because of the extra anger I've been having. Also the more I think about it try to figure it out I think I'm just making it worse. 🙁"
A common occurrence,
Brain zaps?,Does anybody else get brain zaps if they miss meds too many days in a row? I’ve not been very good about taking my medications and keep having these zaps and it’s driving me wild
One psychiatrist says it's depression and another says it's BP.,"In the last year I've had two different psychiatrists due to moving. My first said I have unilaterial depression. My second says it's BPII.

&#x200B;

What I experience - weeks of feeling low followed by a week or a few days of feeling okay. I never experience anything that feels manic like I need to go on a shopping spree/high adrenaline/feeling unstoppable. It's more so bouts of extended meh followed by a short time of yeh!

On a smaller scale, throughout the day my mood can be up-and-down. Feeling okay then being bottomed out with difficulty to recover. At times I can get angry/flustered quite easily which will then ruin my day.

I ask because they want to medicate me, which is fine. But, I don't want to jump from pill-to-pill if I can avoid it. Fluoxitine gave me severe tinnitus and I am terrified of taking any more drugs. It was suggested I take lamictal."
Has lithium given anyone else hair loss? + Mini rant,"Everyone kept telling me I was damn crazy when I said it was starting to happen and now my hair line has receded further beyond belief and I don't know what to do. It doesn't even seem like the medication has helped either. Just given me forehead acne and is making my hairline go higher and higher. I'm just so damn irked right now because it's once again another one of those times where ""you're just imagining"" tland gaslighting me to make me ""feel better"" turns into me being fucking right. My blood tests have all been fine.

Has this happened with lithium for anyone else? What did you do? I can't see my doctor until February."
MAOIs,"i just wanted to open a general discussion about MAOIs/monoamine oxidase inhibitors. i know it's definitely not as common as the ssris and snris being prescribed nowadays so if anyone has any experience with those, let's share some stories! off the top of my head, i know nardil, parnate, marplan are maois."

Mood Journal App?,"So after lastest hospitalization, I want to be more... Pro active? In communicating my moods etc with my doc. I found emoods app that seems perf. 

Does anyone use a similar app? Is it useful? Do doctor's respond well with you showing up with mood charts etc?

Mum has Bipolar and need some assistance.,"Hey guys, Aussie here! My mother has been diagnosed with Bipolar for 30years, and only in most recent years has it become worse. 

She has been on lithium for approx. 3 years. She is having health problems, e.g. weight gain, blood pressure (side affect of lithium), and now more recently: kidney problems.

She is most concerned about her kidney problems, and her newest doctor (whom I suspect isn’t aware of my mother’s mental health) as advised her to stop taking her medication for 2 weeks and test bloods, scans and everything else.

I suspect she has been off her medication since before Christmas, as her family (inclusive of myself) as she is increasingly becoming irritated, flustered, and emotional.

I have tried multiple times to talk with my mother and talk normally, however bringing up: family, drugs, doctors, and psychiatrist/psychologist she comes very emotional, and she starts having an argument, whereas I am trying to talk calmly and get to the bottom of things.

She believes she is a victim, manipulated, bullied, belittled, treated like a child from her immediate family members, and have said, “I don’t ever want them to contact me, nor do I want to contact them ever again”.

I feel this is her lack of medications, as compared to her being on medications she is fine and easier to have a relationship with.

As she is “lashing out and causing grievances”, my mental health is starting to deteriorate because of her actions, I love my mum but it’s harder for me to take care of her, same with her immediate family.


We want to help, but she thinks we are telling her what to do and “gaining up on her”.

I hope to be speaking to her doctor on Tuesday and find out what is going on.


My dilemma is, she is visiting my home town for the long weekend (Australia Day) and I was planning to take her to see Cirque Du Soleil (as a surprise); however, as she has been very irritable and quick to have an argument, I feel my night will be ruined because of her mood. Do I take someone else instead?

I hope someone can provide some insight.


TL;DR: mother has been off medication (doctors orders), family is feeling worried/stressed and being mistreated on her account, as we are trying to help her.
I have tickets to see Cirque du Soleil (as a surprise) but feel she will ruin the evening planned because of her previous actions."
Sick of hearing that medication isn't the most important part of managing a mental illness,"For anyone who needs to hear it, if you're struggling and taking medication, don't let anyone make you feel like a guilty piece of shit when they tell you medication is only half the battle. Medication can be 99% of the battle for some of us. We are running life without the essential chemicals that neurotypicals take for granted. They get on their high horse, congratulating themselves on lifestyle behaviors that led them to feel great... Certainly it isn't their functioning brain that deserves the credit... /s 

Live your best life. Exercise and eat well and manage stress because these are good for life overall. But if you're struggling with bipolar and wondering how that could be when you take medicine... Hearing these delusional people flaunt their health in your face and make you feel guilty about that time you ate fast food for dinner instead of a vegan salad? Let go of that guilt. You are trying as hard as any neurotypical, and then some. You deserve happiness and it's not your fault that you're struggling."
Worst and best feeling.,"When you're manic, you do so much on a day that you are absolutley exhausted to the point that you can finally sleep.

You sleep, end up waking up 2 hours later and you have to start all over again.

The exhaustion feels good, yet waking up with that same energy and having to start all over again is the worst lol."
Has anyone gone through lithium toxicity? My levels tripled out of nowhere and I had to get flushed out. Did you experience any after effects?,
Zoloft side effects,"So I finally went to a psychiatrist after a 10 year lapse in doing anything consistently about my mental health 

The depression is for certain bipolar is still a conversation at this point (I've had one appointment, if its bipolar its either type two or unspecified) but I did feel heard and really really like this place, they even gave me a list of therapists in my area that take my insurance THAT THEY VOUCH FOR 

I'm hopeful, happy to feel comfortable with this psychiatrist office and hopeful about finally taking action to be more functional and hopefully happy again 

Anyway, the point of this post is they gave me 25mg of zoloft for the next two weeks then I follow up, today is my second day taking it and side effects started like immediately! 

I was a little sleepy yesterday but I usually am then headache most of ths last two days despite drinking tons of water, dizziness, stomach pain upset stomach and some diarrhea have been the worst effects though today wasn't as bad as yesterday 

Anyone else experience side effects this quickly? I've heard from others theirs subsided after a while 

I may be a bit hypomanic because I just want to gather as much information on this as I can so if you've got anything to contribute I appreciate it!"
Dose anyone take guanfacine?,"Dr gave me this today. But it’s adhd med...

How to accept weight gain? (ED trigger),"I am on Zoloft and 0.5 mg Rexulti. I was previously on Abilify and gained 15 pounds. I am terrified of eating too much because I’ve heard Rexulti causes weight gain.

The drowning down/ the crash TW?,"So.. dang. I feel like shit. Looking for help, support, a reason to live? I want a reason to feel anything.

I had a really “productive” day at work Monday. I’ve been feeling hypomanic about two weeks and now it’s like the crash. The rest of the week was a mix of nervous energy feelings of hatred toward myself. The hard feelings in the morning, so hard. I don’t know if the thoughts were worse in the morning or bedtime. So dark! Even during the day I found myself thinking things like, “ I wonder how long it will take her to get over it when I kill myself?” Even though I don’t want to hurt myself. 

Oh God just make this feeling over!


Besides that, I think my meds are making me super stupid. I can’t think or catch on to things as fast as I used to . Wtf

Drugs I’m on:
Abilify
Lamictal
Wellbutrin
Buspar 
Clonazepam
Sumatriptan first migraines sometimes

Something’s making me stupid and I want to just stop taking them all because they obviously aren’t working."

Ideas,Hey I crashed from mania yesterday and have been in bed legit 48 hours and I still feel this itchy irritation under my skin everywhere coated in a heavy layer of apathy- not sure how to direct my static energy. I have no interest or pleasure in anything atm. But I feel like I’ve trapped my spirit and need to release myself into something. Used to SH to feel something. Tryna to avoid that lol. Music is even boring to me rn. Tf do I do
What terms offend you??,"I went to my writing group today and someone accused me of “ableist language” because I was trying to rhyme in a children’s poem and used the word ‘loony.’ 


Even though I *have* a mental disorder, they don’t know, and it made me feel like a total asshole and sent me into spiraling self hate.


Anywho, are there terms that trigger you? Are there words you think should be used for “eccentric” vs. mentally different? Give me your words! Please. I need all I can get."
Stressful week. Slept for 12 hours. Feel like a superhero.,"This week felt like the gods packed any and all possible stressful situations into 4 short days. I feel like I got way more done this week than any week prior. 

During the week, I felt like I was going 300 miles an hour, unfazed. Nothing could break my stride.

And when Friday hit I got dinner with my SO, fell asleep at midnight, and woke up 12 hours and 100 dreams later. I feel like I could run a 5k. 

Gonna take my meds and wear all my comfy clothes today so I'm not tempted by manic fate. Thankful I know my rhythms.

"BP1, psychosis and shrooms","Hey r/bipolar, long time no see. Bipolar Type 1 here. Just wondering if anyone has had any experience with psilocybin mushrooms. I've been thinking of taking 1 gram next week. Have they triggered mania/psychosis for you?"
some strange recurring dreams and not sure how to interpret them,"had a couple dreams last night, one where I was spending a first date with a slightly older man (maybe 15 years older than me) and his family didn’t approve of me, which is a recurring theme for me in my dreams, not being liked by the people around me. this one isn’t too off-base because I tend to always feel in real life that the people around me don’t like me, without fail as long as I can remember that feeling eats at me.

second dream was that I was running away from a young boy, through a huge beach house, with a handful of friends and family members, it wasn’t totally clear who besides a couple. I had to keep snaking through this maze of a house through secret doors and hidden staircases and every time the kid was close, i’d turn around and just repeatedly punch him. he never got bruised or bloodied and id go back to running away and the cycle continued until I woke up. 

the recurring theme of the first dream makes sense and always has made sense to me, but the second one of running and never feeling like i’m getting any further from the danger/going in circles was always vague to me and kinda eats at me for a while each time. 

I wonder if it has to do with feeling like in life, every time I feel like i’m making progress i backtrack, one step forward two steps back kind of thing. I tend to feel suffocated and restless and want to just drop everything move far away and start over and forget that i’m a fuck up who will probably end up holding myself back from achieving my dreams because i’ll end up fucking it up in one way or another. i guess i’d like to just break free from myself. I also used to be in a very controlling and emotionally/sometimes physically abusive relationship and i’m petrified of ever being restricted like that ever again.

I guess this is just more of voicing some weird feelings, but does anyone have any recurring dreams where they’ve figured out how to overcome the negative feelings that follow? how to make the best of it? how to brush it off?"

The Music of Mania,"So I was listening to this [Death Grips song](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=y2cQvZPX3OY) the other day and thought to myself, “wow this really sounds like what my first manic episode felt like.”

I think it’s interesting how music has the ability to elicit sensory aspects of our memories much deeper than any other artistic medium. When I listened to that song it reminded me of how quickly my mind was making disparate associations between religion and bathtubs or my dog and Mass Effect 2. Just the sheer incoherence and and energy of this song really got me back to headspace of my mania; not in a triggering way, but almost like a visit to a diner I haven’t been to in a really long time.

I don’t know if anyone feels the same but I’m curious about what your musical associations to mania are (or if you even have any). Ya that’s it. Happy saturday!"
Students with bipolar disorder - How do you do it?,"I'm college freshman and I'm barely passing exams. It was always like that. When depression hits I'm having trouble with everything but studying is especially hard. I'm doing what I can but the best I can in terms of academic performance is ""barely passing"". I know I'm intelligent and hard-working enough to be really good at things. 

Is there anything I can do to improve? I don't have much control over how much time I spend in remission. But there has to be something I can actually do. I'm on medication that isn't affecting my cognitive abilities, I live healthy lifestyle, I'm aware of my style of learning, I study with a friend when I can.

When I was in remission I was an excellent student. Recent cycling left me with a bit of impairment. I have difficulty thinking but I know I will recover after some time. Currently I'm depressed and it's just not that easy to do things. I want to perform better but I don't know how. What works for you?"

i tried telling him you really cant control it, its something that just happens. and its more than just depression and he really doesn't understand that and keeps fighting me about it.

Things have been going great but out of nowhere my ability to cope with my depression has gone down the drain. I had a bit of a freak out and haven’t gone into work the last two days. Do I share with my boss, the social worker, about why I’ve been acting this way? I scheduled an appointment with my doctor and am going to start counseling because I know I can’t handle this on my own anymore. But I’m terribly frightened about the stigma especially working in healthcare.

Little sister just diagnosed!,"Hi, all!

I (25F) have been on my sister (23F) for six years trying to get her to see a doctor because I suspected her being bipolar. She has a son (5M) and child protective services have tried to take him away several times leading to me and our cousin (45F) having him the majority of the time.

She had been all over the place for many years, and I often take the train to hers to clean her apartment and such so that her son has a safe and healthy enviornment. She beat me up pretty badly while we were visiting family over christmas, and she was a total wreck again for weeks after. I told her that I am happy to help her with her son, but that I couldn’t be as much present for her personally anymore if she didn’t at least try and get help. This was a tipping point for her, and I finally got her to see a doctor this week.

She actually got diagnosed and is starting medication pretty soon! She sent me a long message last night thanking me and telling me that she’s scared, so I am wondering how I can be there for her 100% now that she’s actually making progress?

Any specifics I should have in mind? All insight is greatly appreciated!


I am also very interested in the relationship between bipolar and PTSD/childhood trauma if anyone can shed some light."

Am I having an episode?,I’ve been going between feeling great and being deeply depressed for the past week and my dad just came home and asked me what I was going to do with a plant that’s in our living room and it’s been dying because it’s too cold here for it. I told him I don’t care and he can throw it away and he said “are you sure?” And I said I don’t care in kind of a mean tone and he asked me if I was okay and I said yes and he said “are you sure you’re okay?” And I started crying. Over nothing. That hasn’t happened to me in a while. I have no attachment to the plant. I don’t know why I cried over that.
New here! First post BP1 (Lithium),"Hello everyone. 

This is my first post. It took me a lot of courage typing this and hope I can reach others who are on the same boat as me. I got some questions at the end if you wanna skip to that part.

I'm 26 and recently started on **lithium** (exactly 3 days ago) because of BPD1. Was a hard decision (sometimes I sat outside the hospital for **hours** getting the courage to get inside and ask for a doctor it's been hard for me to accept I got BPD, after days of going there and coming back home frustrated for not being able to even put a foot inside the hospital I finally did it)

I was getting many issues with mania such as hypersexuality, deliriums, paranoia, insomnia. I have also felt depressed and had **Wellbutrin** for that (lethargy, constant uncontrollable crying, and suicidal thoughts. 

Changed to another doc who addressed my case as BPD instead of Depression so here I am with **Lithium 300mg twice a day**. I make sure to take it 12 hours separately from each other. I keep myself hydrated as much as possible and keep a healthy diet. 

I noticed I got lightheaded after doing exercise today. 

After several months (almost a year) of hesitating to start lithium (I've felt that I haven't got any BPD when I got manic, that maybe I'm an overthinker etc..) I got prescribed and honestly feel nervous about the possible side effects: *Liver toxicity, renal failure, thyroids issues, hair loss, memory loss...* 

Besides Lithium I'm taking Advanced B complex (AOR), NAC 1200 a day (Jarrow 600mg x2) **I asked my doc about using NAC and she told me it's totally OK.** Biotin 10.000mcg, Gamma E complex 225IU (half daily dosage)  **L-tyrosine 500mg**, Magnesium citrate 400mg (at night)

**Questions I've got:** 

I understand my dosage isn't as high as others' I've read on this sub. and also that all depends on my blood levels of lithium, still is this considered a dosage that would bring those side effects I mentioned? 

Would you mind to share any advice to avoid those side effects? 

I like going to the sauna and exercising. For the ones that constantly workout and/or go to the **sauna** do you have any advice on how to keep safe from the lithium toxicity mostly on the **sauna**?

For the ones that take supplements or have knowledge/exp about it. What are your thoughts on my supplements stack? Any recommendation for someone taking lithium? What vits/supps do you use? 

Thank you in advance."
Smelling things that aren’t there?,"Question from a BPSO for BP people - rn my husband is smelling a strong cigarette smell that we know is not physically present.    (This followed about a dat after a downturn after he took his medication 3 hours late.)  I’ve googled a bit and found out this can happen, because emotional processing and olfactory processing happen near each other in the brain.    This has happened a few times before, less intensely and with other, usually unpleasant, smells.  

Does anyone have suggestions on how to cope, if the smell hallucination itself seems to be causing irritation?  (We are trying scented candles.)  In your experience, do these smell hallucinations mean anything?

Feelings of wanting to escape,"Lately I’ve really been fantasizing about running away and starting a new life elsewhere. Cutting off contact with everyone else in my life and going from place to place like a wanderess. I dropped out my last six months of law school and I’ve had a bit of a change at heart. I know I have enough money to do so. It just feels so weird when I’ve been so hardstuck on my career and wanting this future for so long, only to just go down this path. I find it hard to differentiate whether or not this is just a random phase that everyone experiences. I’m just done with everything here and I feel like I have a way bigger mission to accomplish elsewhere. I feel like everyone just thinks I’m crazy for doing this, it’s my life after all. My parents are not happy about this at all and they’re trying to make me go back. Is this normal?"

Back here.. again,"I'm back on the kitchen floor crying. I should be working for university right now. And then getting myself ready for work. I know I'll manage to work, I nearly always do. But everything else just.. doesn't happen. 
I've been trying so hard recently. Trying to eat regularly to put on a bit of weight, trying to get into routines. I've tried decluttering the apartment. But nothing works. 
I've slept 12 hours today. I'm usually a very active person, but now I just try to stay in bed so I won't have to deal with reality anymore. It doesn't work, at all. To dos are piling up. I'm also a very organized person. I love lists, I love planning ahead. No plan works anymore. I do plan out my days. Then I stare at the list as time passes and hate myself more with every second that passes by without me doing something.  I'm very confused, I can't  focus. I'm not quite sure when I ate the last time, I just know I feel sick all the time.
At times like this I truly wonder how many more times I can pick myself up again. Even though it's not extremely bad, it's just all so tiring. I keep going for the people that I know would miss me and for my dogs. I've been in places so much worse than today. Objectively I know that I managed to do quite a lot in the last year. But that doesn't really help me when I can't even remotely feel happy. Or content. Even just not really shitty or apathetic would be enough..
I'm so tired. Of breaking down. Of having to pick up the pieces afterwards again. My family doesn't get it. They think I just have to think happy thoughts and try a little harder. 
Thanks for reading, I just had to get everything off my chest. And sorry for rambling. I'm just.. very confused again."
Life in a kitchen. Stressful places. But i thrive and suffer in them. Any kitchen workers out there? How do you deal with the stress of it? I'm about to jump back into that life.,
On too many medications,"Once upon a time last year, I used to pride myself in the fact I only took lithium. My doctor got really lazy and started prescribing me all sorts of things: zolpidem, benzos, antipsychotics. 

At first I trusted him, but now everybody is telling me this can’t be normal. I’m on 7 tablets of risperidone, 9 of quetiapine, 10mg of zolpidem and 1660mg lithium. My cabinet looks absolutely ridiculous. 

I wanna start reducing the zolpidem and the antipsychotics. Should I look for another doctor? That sounds like a pain in the ass, but it probably is necessary. 

Ty and best."

Equanimity is lying in my bad not wanting to get out my house and being fine with that but being wide awake for 24 plus hours and live out different lives in between consciousness and unconsciousness. There isn’t always an end"
Less tolerant of small talk and other's opinions,"I am 26 (F) diagnosed with bp2 within the last 6 months. I feel amazing, and I am so glad that I was diagnosed and started meds. It has been life changing.

I've noticed that since I have been on my meds I have less of a tolerance for being around groups of people that are more of aquaintances and conversations that mainly consist of small talk. I just have lost all sense of that. I feel like it is a giant waste of time/energy and I avoid it at all costs. I sometimes feel like I'm being a bitch, but I honestly don't even care. 

I've also noticed that I enjoy alone time more, and don't find myself wanting to keep busy and go out more. I'm not sure if this is a side of the medication, or if anyone else experiences this. I go to family events, and I like hanging out with my cousins that are int he same age range, but other than family I don't keep in contact with old friends, and to be quit honest with myself I don't really care to spend my time and energy with someone that isn't family. It's the same boring conversations, talking about how we should do this more often, reminiscing on the past, and then leaving feeling soooo tired. 

I recently went to my soon to be sister in law's bachelorette party and I ended up having a minor depressive episode on day 3 because I was tired and annoyed. Luckily I was able to feel better after a nap and some quiet time, but I wondered if the meds have anything to do with this. I told my brother this, and he stated that he thought it was good for me to engage and socialize.  It really made me think that people don't care if you're an introvert or extrovert, that will just dump what they think you should do onto you, and expect you to conform. 

It's very gratifying to finally be a able to have a positive self image and realize that he actually doesn't know what is good for me, I do. No one else knows what is good for me except me. Before I got diagnosed I would take other people's opinions of me so seriously, and get upset about it. I am really enjoying listening to my self and not caring about what people think I should or should't do anymore! Obviously there are people that I trust like my mentor or my bf, and take to heart their considerations and opinions more seriously, but I still am ultimately going to do what is best for me.

What made you realise you had more than just anxiety/depression?,"Ive been diagnosed with anxiety and depression since I was a very young kid, I’m 19 now and I don’t feel validated by that diagnosis anymore. Most of the time I either feel like I’m loosing my mind or I just don’t want to be here anymore. I stared hearing things and becoming overly hyper and out of control and unable to control intrusive thoughts which seemed a lot different to my normal level of anxiety.
I spoke with my GP and a psych about it all and she kind of minimised it, although they did say we should consider bipolar. 

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want bipolar, but i’m also not an idiot and I know there is something very wrong mentally and bipolar seems to make more sense to me than depression or anxiety.

"Just Got the 'Emotional Rollercoaster' designator/signal on my mood app, ha.","I'm finally tracking this thing everyday, and tracking how my moods change drastically within the day (has been happening more lately, that change during day thing).

I'm not just talking 'I'm kinda sad' then 'I'm alright'/'sad'; I mean, going from a morning walk I didn't realize was an hour with my hands freezing at 6:30AM because I loved this morning and I love the sunrise colors and how reminiscent they are of spring; to mehhhh anxiety and a tonal shift in the day on the train, after minutes walking and appreciating the colors outside on all the buildings I passed. 

Anyone else not use the 'rad' feature until they realized the 'really good' mood they had wasn't just 'good'?"
Everything seems impossible and hopeless,"I’ve been really going through it lately with being in grad school and also being extremely mentally ill. I’m constantly reaching out to get connected with a therapist that’s capable of helping me through a severe depressive episode and working through past trauma. I also have PCOS and a stressful job so I’m basically a train wreck but come across as “normal” to most people. I show up to work each day to my stressful and emotionally taxing job and never miss classes (I’m in 5 grad classes and it’s already been overwhelming as shit). I’m only 22 and just can’t handle shit and feel like I’m about to be pushed over the edge. 

At night I’ve really been experiencing suicidal thoughts and sob for hours and can’t sleep. Ativan has stopped working. Lunesta has stopped working. My pdoc had me try trazodone and it didn’t work and made me feel weird. I’m trying out Lamictal and have titrated up to 100 mg. I also have ADHD and take adderall. I just don’t know what to do with me anymore. My anxiety on top of everything has been so hard. I’ve tried all these different meds with little success. Fucking SSRIs through me into hypomania at 20 and have fucked up my life at this point. 

I guess I’m wondering what others would offer as advice for the insomnia, mixed depressive episodes, suicidality, and dealing with lamictal. Is it worth it to hang in there with the lamictal or should I reach out to my psychiatrist? I’ve been taking it since the beginning of January. I don’t want her to worry and commit me or some shit. 

I am currently also in therapy but I have a shitty therapist and am trying to get in with a psychologist that’s more capable of handling the intensity of my mental illnesses. I just don’t know how to pull through and be well at this point. I’ve been depressed for most of my life and can’t handle these deep lows. I don’t think I can handle the lows getting lower and lower anymore. I also have no support system which doesn’t help. 

I guess I’m looking for encouragement and suggestions on coping with bipolar 2 and what meds have worked for others. I just don’t know what to do at this rate. I’m up and down all the time and it’s been almost impossible to cope with. How have others pulled through all this?"
Help. I haven’t had insurance in years. I’ve always been diagnosed depressed but it has recently come to my attention that I fall under this category.

Is it possible to prevent weight gain from atypical antipsychotics?,"I’m on Rexulti and have been so for a couple weeks now. It isn’t making me feel worse, which is always a plus, but I’m noticing I’ve gained weight. I feel very self conscious about my weight, and while I’ve only gained a couple pounds, it’s still scary. I read that atypical antipsychotics cause insulin resistance, which leads to weight gain. Should I ask my psychiatrist to prescribe me something for weight loss? I am already on Wellbutrin and Adderall for depression and anxiety. You’d think those two would help with weight, but they do not. I’ve started intermittent fasting and have still gained weight (to be fair, it’s only been two days). I’m trying out white kidney bean extract because I had some around the house.

i'm banned from emailing my psychiatrist,"i stopped my meds & have been pretty erratic lately. i already had a bad habit of emailing my pdoc (who is also my therapist) too much but as i decompensated it got worse. i've learned in therapy i am needy & attention seeking at times so there's that. 

i wanted to get back on my meds & i was emailing him begging for guidance on what dose i can safely start at but he was ignoring me so, stupidly, i started rapid firing emails, first continuing to beg but then threatening to find a new doctor. he ended up calling my mom (that caused quite a mess) but told her what i had to do to restart my meds & now i'm back on them. feeling much better too. 

anyway, now i'm banned from emailing for a month. pathetic."
Question,"Hi all! My sister has come away with me on holiday and realised she’s not taken enough medication with her olanzapine, metrazapine, depokate. (Sorry for poor spelling) she won’t have any for four days and I’m wondering how dangerous that might be? We’re in the Philippines so not too easy to buy over the counter. We could go to the doctors if need be. Any advice you might have would helpful."

Job makes me cry. Pls help," I dislike my job so much it makes me cry. I’ve tried radical acceptance  but it isn’t working. I am doing therapy & meds but IDK what else to do. I see my therapist on Tuesday. 

I have to wait sometime before I leave."
worried about boyfriend,"I’m writing something here because a lot of the time I’m not sure where to go when my boyfriend deals with his bipolar episodes. I love this man to absolute death and I would do literally anything for him so it’s really hard for me to see him in that shape even tho I know why. Also a lot of the time during mania episodes especially he shuts me out and it hurts. I know he might be trying to protect me but it’s all just very confusing to me. I know for bipolar disorder one of the best solutions is in fact meds but he’s apparently “tried them all” and nothings worked and he’s currently unable to find a therapist to take him on for some reason so I have nothing I can physically do to help I just have to sit on the sidelines holding his hand through it. I know that this is the bipolar reddit but sense I struggle with extreme ocd it’s hard when he shuts me out to not obsess and overthink the fact that he’s not communicating with me. I’m hoping for some guidance, anything that could help."
Y’all ever throw up because you’re THAT angry?,I didn’t eat today either so I’ve just been dry heaving for 10 minutes.
Great news,"So in my past relationship that i didn't end, the person reason was always my bipolar symptoms. Well I've been dating a guy for a week and I was thinking great, good no symptoms.

 But then when it started getting alittle dirty and half way through my mood flipped from being really happy to breaking down in tears and no other guy has every stopped so fast and comforted me

It was amazing, i always thought i was gonna end up alone because of my bipolar but now i have hope again"
Manic delusions,How often do you have reoccurring delusions during manic periods over the years? Delusions in the same camp as previous manias?
Anxiety and bipolar good friends?,How much does your bipolar manifest as anxiety? Just curious for my own diagnosis
Probably should go to the hospital but I'm way too traumatized,I have been depressed and suicidal for a week now. I'm definitely having a mixed episode which scares me because I feel very very unwell. I want to go somewhere safe but all the hospitals are terrible. I went once and I  told myself never again. It was a absolute nightmare. My partner is leaving for a trip on Monday for a whole week. I don't know what I'm going to do with myself. Plus I have to many responsibles to just go away for a bit. I don't know what to do.

"Amazing how triggering being physically ill can be, isn't it?","I had Wendy's chicken nuggets last night and woke up SO SICK this morning... honestly not sure if it's food poisoning or just a coincidence and I have some kind of viral thing.

PS: why do we need flair on posts all the time now?!"
Should I keep myself isolated?,"I notice that I feel the need again to constantly meet up with everyone I know. Meanwhile I have been out of contact with anyone for 1 month.

I am scared if I meet up with everyone again that I will embarass myself, because I might turn manic and I know that I can be inappropriate and people get wrong ideas about me.

Posting on Reddit at 8am after 2 hours sleep and wondering if I'm hypomanic. Again.,"I don't *think* I am. I think it's just because I've been over-dependent on zopiclone lately and didn't take any last night. And because Reddit is so addictive. The methamphetamine of the internet.

I find the hypervigilance you need to be bipolar an absolute bitch. But it's necessary. My hypomania has had severe practical  consequences in the past, Now every time I get sociable, or creative or generally Up, I have to check myself: 'Am I allowed to be happy?'

I mean...I *know* when I'm depressed..."
I found a great free app for tracking moods.,"Its called eMoods. Its free. No ads which is awesome. Medication tracker. Talk therapy tracker. And settings and a graph that tracks your moods like depression and anxiety and you can rate it by severity of symptoms. I have found it really useful for tracking my sleep and depression. Hope you can all find it and hope it helps. Purely for bipolar disorder. Here is the link. Its only for android I think though so thats the only downside.

Am I making it up!?,"I'm undiagnosed... This is partly why I question it. But I've had episodes of depression, defiantly - one of them lasting months - and I've had episodes very similar to hypomania: days in which music is like intertwined with my mind, making my skin feel electric - super optimism, grandiosity - artistic, writing painting - manic interests - sexual change - caffeine... 
My sleep does decrease, sort of... At times it can be bellow six hours. And I have flash backs In these episodes to other episodes: like  nostalgic ecstasy... 
When I re-evaluate my childhood I could defiantly be describe as a bipolar kid - serious sleep problems - mood swings - insane energy - I remember walking down the street as a kid saying out loud to my self: ""life is good!"" 
 I don't know... I need to get diagnosed, obviously. 
How do I bring it up in therapy? 
What would it mean of I'm not? What does that say about my hypomanic like episodes!? 
Thanks for any answers."
Finally realizing you're slipping into hypomania only after 3 days of persistantly lashing out at your significant other for literally no reason,My hypomania shows itself in anxiety and anger. I rarely get the 'good' hypomania. I am not having a good time. I'm worried its because of starting Concerta (I have adhd). I was on adderall years ago and had no issues with it but my insurance refuses to put me on it unless I have a bad reaction to Concerta. How fucked is that?

I am just wondering now what do I do in my free time?

I donate to my local food bank when I can, I give money to the church when I can because I know they do good in the community, even if I am not sure I am 100% Christian.

I be as kind as I can be to everyone in my life and everyone I meet.

Walk my dog, journal, read and research anything I can get my hands on about bipolar, workout, eat well, re-budget everyday as I only get money once a month, play guitar, listen to music that moves me, listen to podcasts, visit family, keep up to date with friends new and old. Play computer games in-between.

Lithium Side Effects?,"Hi friends, I’ve been on lithium for 4 months now and up until recently I have really loved it. Ive gained weight (25 lbs) but I typically gain quite a bit during the holidays and I lose it fairly easily once spring hits. My main concern is my hair. I’ve used drugs, like depakote, in the past that left me nearly bald and although I’m not losing crazy amounts yet I’m still scared of that happening. I’m currently taking 450 mg in the morning and 600 mg at night. I’m just curious if hair loss is a common side effect with lithium at this dose?"

lithium and lexapro,"lord knows why my psych put me on an SSRI right after she took me off of a different SSRI but i'm trusting her judgement over my own—i'm hoping some of y'all have been on lexapro and lithium at the same time :(
i feel myself rapidly cycling and constantly feeling nauseous.  i noticed this started when i was bumped up to 10mg lexapro on top of my 900mg lithium. does anyone have experience with these symptoms/with this combo in general? please share your experiences if you'd like!"
I kinda stopped a manic phase,"I caught myself rearranging my house last night at 10 pm and told myself i needed to stop and get in the bed. I got comfy in bed but spent a lot of the night researching random bullshit on the internet. Even though i learned more useless facts, i got more sleep than i would have if i would’ve continued to rearrange the house. I feel more calm today and less manic!"
What an absolute mess that never ends,"Ok this might be long, but i need to vent somewhere,  throwaway account for many reasons.  This past summer my physical health went from not very good to absolutely horrific,  hospitalizations,  starvation for months,  scopes and mris and a cancer scare and ecoli and i broke.  I think i had always been bipolar my entire adult life but it was mild and i had a handle on it.  Until suddenly i didn't.  I was in a 10 year faithful marriage and i found myself wanting and having sex with any man i could.  Shopping.  Not sleeping.  Typical mania.  I did this from July to November when i crashed,  hard.  I called a friend to take me to a psych hospital.  I needed a diagnosis and treatment,  I'm bipolar type 1, cptsd, gad and something else i can't remember. I have a long history of sexual abuse starting at age 5,  trauma, rape,  emotional and physical abuse from parents siblings and my ex husband. This was my first time in my nearly 40 years on earth that i sought help. My first visit with a dr in there and he was fun,  easy to talk to,  sure he wanted to focus on my exes perverse sex likes but ok we were discussing sex since it was part of my issue. Itold him how many times ive been victimized sexually and that it's like i have the word victim on my forehead,  that they always know how to find me.  Generally i spot them a mile away but i was completely mentally broken.  So i get out and i see him weekly,  first appointment starts with him asking me to stand up and turn around so he could see what i looked like not in hospital clothes. Weird but hey he's easy to talk to and i need that and he's letting me really be part of the meds process. I hate meds i don't even take tylenol.  Again im still a shell of myself.  6 week mark we are too the point of talking marriage,  sex, love,  exchanging pictures,  talking daily. I confessed to my husband who i love tremendously and has been amazing through all of this.  My dr was telling me which meds to skip at this point so i would be manic when i came in for visits.  That resulted in a suicide attempt instead of mania.  I went to my last appt because i had to get refills because you know how hard it is to get on with a new dr.  I recorded the appt (1 party consent state), and he kissed me,  talked about the meds,  all kinds of crap.  I listened to it on the way home and i was so angry at myself for becoming a victim again.  Then he called me,  and i was immediately ready to run away with him,  abandon my 17&18 year old daughter's in their last year of high school,  abandon my devoted amazing husband,  my entire life. He had the tools to fix me and instead he used them against me.  Somehow his wife figured it out on the one night my husband has ever checked my phone,  no lie.  Everything blows up.  Anyway i have the recording,  i have screen shots,  i have lawyers.  What i don't have is trust of any Male drs,  no psych dr until mid feb, i need med adjustments because I'm too down still.  Probably because i still have all my health issues,  I'm still a mess with bipolar because i can't get my meds adjusted and i might be in a lawsuit.  Oh and on my daughter's 18th birthday she was hospitalized for 5 seizures in one day resulting in a car accident.  She's ok and we're getting set up with drs etc.  My already full plate is just broken.  Im broken.  I can't even make it to most of my kids school functions or cook or clean or anything.  The one time i reached out for help in my very traumatized fucked up life and another fucking predator found me while i was in exactly the right state of mind.  Im so angry at the universe right now.  Fuck.  I just want normalcy and to feel normal but i don't even know what that is anymore."
More like BRUHpolar tbh,
It do be like that,
Does almost not sleeping increase psychosis chance?,
keep hitting roadblocks in my journey to recovery!!!!! (vent),"It seems that no matter how much I try to help myself out and try to get better and work on myself, shit keeps hitting the fan! Been med compliant but nothing is working and now my insurance company doesn't want to cover my meds, with a Good Rx coupon it's upwards of $1,100 for a months supply of some new medication idek will help me.  What's the point of being med compliant, what's the point of being healthy, if shit keeps going wrong. 

It'd be fine if those were the only stressors, but I've got school tuition I can't get financial aid for (due to being a DACA recipient), the pressure of trying to find applicable scholarships, the question of whether or not going back to school is smart given the cost and maybe I won't be good at this, car payments and phone bills and other necessities, trying to find (a) new job(s), and juggling my health and the dysphoria and dysmorphia. I thought I'd be able to take a break or something, get a breather, after getting fired but I guess not!!!!! 

So ofc now I just wanna do such stupid reckless things, get drunk, try drugs!, go clubbing, hook up with strangers, get back in touch with the shitty ex my friends hate, just drive fast, stupid things I know aren't good but I don't care anymore. It's frustrating and angering and I'm tired and I don't care about myself really, because what's the fucking point lmao. I know I can get through this, fine, sure. But I want to dwell in this anger and recklessness and hurt myself. 

I'm like seconds away from ghosting my friends because it'll be easier on them, because I'm going to be unbearable because I just don't give a shit anymore. It's easier to cut them off before they decide they don't want me, it's easier to just force the goodbye instead of it catching me by surprise. And even if they care, if I disappear, at most they'll just miss me. They won't have to know I'm gone. Partially I also know that this is going to hurt me and that's why I want to do it, it'll hurt me to hurt them, but also I don't think it'll hurt them. 

My mind is racing I want to fix my issues but I'm tired of fixing things only for more things to go wrong. I want to live a little and be stupid and reckless and just get out my anger and just submit to the wishes of self destruction. I feel like a fucking idiot for thinking I could be happy lmao, God.  I feel like an idiot for feeling hopeful every time it seems like things can be good maybe. Because then they suck and they go down the drain and I'm heartbroken every time, as if I hadn't learned from all the times before. 

I'm tired and angry and upset and feel like I've lost control and I'm sick of that and I just don't know what to do at this point. I don't care, I wanna get into some shit, just go fucking apeshit at this point, but I don't know what or how and apparently I'm still holding myself back like a coward. But i'm just fucking done."
I don't know how to deal with fucking up at work/socially.,"I fuck up at work a lot. I work at a school so it involves having to socialize with people more often. Sometimes I don't realize until after that I said that wrong thing or may have sounded rude or manipulative. I hate it. I want to kill myself, I don't know how to deal. I end up cutting or hurting myself. Why can't I just be normal? I fucked up today by sounding like I'm a big deal but I'm not. I'm manic today. And I just want to control it. I want it to stop."
"Since There Was No Freak Out Friday Post/Thread,","I feel like I'm focusing too much on the diagnosis.    
I feel like I'm being robbed of my past. The fun quirks and times I remember and things I was proud of were actually symptoms of the disease.  
I'm afraid to do anything because now I no longer feel in control of myself. Was I ever in control?  
I am convincing myself that I am insane. But not in the medical sense. More the philosophical one.  
I feel like I could be on a kick, or stable, or somewhat happy if I didn't stop myself. I feel I'm so afraid of going manic that I'm purposely stifling myself and yet I want to be manic (A part of me really does love it especially since I'm normally only hypomanic, it was nice experiencing full blown - I know I shouldn't say/believe it *shrug*)

Edit: Also feel like a loser because when I was manic I was starting a business to escape the rat race and my goal tomorrow is to wash a damn spoon."

I have a feeling Monday is going to bring me a hospital trip,"3:30 pm on Friday 

The psych clinic I have an appointment with on Monday calls and says I need to bring proof of income for my appointment because its a sliding scale payment, otherwise I have to pay $250. 

I tell them I currently have no job, I was terminated on 12/15, I  can bring my check stubs from December and my termination letter.
They say nope, not good enough. I need to get something from the social security office. Which is 45 minutes from me, closes at 4, and is closed Saturday and Sunday. 

Sat on hold with the social security office for 35 minutes now. when I called it said my wait time was 1 hour.  So here's hoping they answer and I don't just get ""uh actually we're closed""

This is the only place around I can go to other than back to the hospital because my insurance doesn't cover psych.

Update: 1 hour 37 minutes on hold. Yeehaw.

Update: after 2.5 hours on hold I hung up. So let's see. Monday of they tell me I have to pay $250 (while unemployed and 11 dollars in my account) I'm popping a U turn and taking my ass to the hospital"
Just given a drop of hope!,"I had a meeting with my psychiatrist today and we discussed how my mood swings and hallucinations are coming back. He doubled my dose of Trileptal and is now recommending that I find a new neurologist. He believes it’s possible that my epilepsy is causing more of my mental issues than we first thought.If I can treat the epilepsy better, then maybe there’s hope for me yet. Wish me luck guys!"
Does euphoria ALWAYS mean mania?,
"For people with bipolar 2, can you tolerate SSRIs or do they make you more agitated and tense?","I’ve been on and off Prozac and Lamictal since I was 17. Now I’m 22, and I’m finding that I’m trending more towards hypomania than I am depression unlike when I was first prescribed medication. Prozac and Lamictal definitely helped me get out of a depressive episode but even though my depression is under control, I struggle with agitation, tenseness, racing thoughts, impulsivity, etc. I’m seeing a new psychiatrist on Tuesday and I want to discuss getting off Prozac and maybe increasing my Lamictal dose. Or should I start a new med altogether? I just hope that taking the Prozac away doesn’t send me down into depression. But honestly, dysphoric hypomania is almost as unbearable.

I would love to hear what meds work for you guys. What’s helped the most with getting the hypomania under control? What do you need to avoid depressive episodes? I take pretty good care of myself so I’m not worried about improving my diet or needing to exercising more and I’ve got a great support system. I’ve done hundreds of hours of therapy. Honestly the only thing fucking me up is my mood swings so I really feel like my medication needs to change.

Edited because I forgot to add that I’m a rapid cycler. I only have a week break between episodes, tbh. And it fucking sucks."
What Song Sounds Like Mania To You?,
Med advice question,"Sorry if this isn't the place for this kinda question, I don't know who to ask... I took bupropion (wellbutrin) for about four weeks and felt AMAZING for the first time in over a decade. Better than manic phase amazing. Then I developed a severe allergic reaction to it. I was in and out of the ER for a couple days with my throat swelling up, and I was covered in hives for over a week while it was working its way out of my system. My doctor put me on another NRI, I didn't like it as well, but it doesn't matter because I had another allergic reaction. Now I'm on an SSRI. I've read that SSRI's can cause rapid-cyclers to cycle even faster/worse.... I'm newly diagnosed, so new to all of this. I've taken SSRI's in the past for my 'depression', and never really cared for the side effects, and never taken them for long because they ""helped"" (I became manic). Should I just stick to mood stabilizers? Is there another option out there if I'm allergic to bupropion even though it helped soooo much? I'm currently taking trokendi in addition to the SSRI. Thanks in advance for any help."
Money problems,"Hello, I have a huge issue: I’m spending too much on psychologist, shrink and pills and I don’t have a freaking job. I’m journalist (I ended college last year) but I haven’t find job, not even on common things like McDonald’s or that kinda jobs.  My parents don’t agree with my therapy, they really DONT, so I feel really humiliated when I have to ask for money. 

What can I do? I don’t have the option of having a health secure or help from other people (family)"
Curious about people's experience with agitation?,"I've often seen people talking about how they know someone who they believe has bipolar or that has even possibly been diagnosed, and that the main thing they've observed is that they're easily agitated and it's easy for them to go from 0 to 100 in terms of being angry. I always can't help but think this is part of the general misconception about bipolar that it's not about just being 'moody' or having 'mood swings' but dealing with, y'know, depressive and manic episodes. I know during a manic and/or hypomanic episode being more easily irritated happens, but I kind of figure the other symptoms of both of those are a little bit more noticable and what people would be commenting on instead.

My own experience is a little bit limited; I have Bipolar Type 1 which has involved strong episodes but with limited frequency. Throughout my life I've had lots of intense episodes of depression and one severe manic episode resulting in hospitalisation. Since then I've thankfully found medication that works well for me and I've had a couple of hypomanic episodes but they've been well under control. 

I only know two other people who are diagnosed with bipolar; one is a friend who's a really sweet person, and the other was my grandmother who was ... a bit much. But a lot of that really had to do with who she was otherwise, not her illness. 

So my question to other people who've had a different experience with bipolar and experience with different types of cycles; is being snappy and having to have people walk on egg shells around you a common part of your experience or is it one of those other things that are often misattributed to being bipolar?"
I decided to add color to this one and I'm not sure if I like it or not. This is supposed to represent severe depressive disorder but I feel like symbolism is a little too obvious. Hope yall enjoy though :),
Diagnosed updated,"Originally I was diagnosed with bipolar 2. I most definitely had a manic/psychosis episode last year. After a while, my therapist thought my diagnosed should actually be updated to bipolar 1 because of that. It makes sense. I’m still processing because I don’t fully know all the differences. It doesn’t effect my treatment but it is probably a clearer picture of what’s going on. 

Has anyone else had experience with this?"
Do Bipolar and BPD mimic each other? And addiction,"I have definite symptoms of both. I question my bipolar 2 diagnosis although when I think about it, I feel its accurate. Certain symptoms I cannot distinguish between to the two, and sometimes I think it may be both.

Also, I was drinking heavily for years and years. I started taking latuda and my urge to drink is gone. Is it that proof that the meds are taking away the depression and feeling of needing a crutch? I guess so"

Medication advice wanted!," I have Type 2, unmedicated currently.  In the past I've been soooo resistant to medication.

After a lot of lifestyle changes (CBT/DBT,meditation, exercise, more sunlight, bipolar-friendly diet changes) which have drastically turned it around, I'm willing to try medication. I'm sure there's always a way to try harder, but fuck it.

My issue is my mania.  I'm a sweetheart but I get anxious and that can also morph into angry outbursts.  Calm to outbursts of hurt or rage in milliseconds.  I don't want to be like that anymore.

&#x200B;

If you also have issues with mania, way more than with depression, what medications helped you?  What were the struggles as you found your right dosage, if you did?  What'd you feel excited or good about, as you felt changes in yourself?  What are compromises you've dealt with, and what's okay and what's not?  (I'd rather have anger outbursts than feel like a zombie, for example, but I also know that medications have gotten a lot better this decade.)"

I think I fucked up.,"I’m a mess. I decided about a month ago to stop taking my birth control because it’s been making me feel physically sick for the last 3 years, and I’m over it. 

Since then, I’ve been going through some of the most intense hypomania I’ve had in years. I didn’t really see it until it starting to get really destructive by drained my fucking account thinking paying off all my credit cards at once was smart and almost cheating on my boyfriend. I’ve been on Wellbutrin for over a year now, but I think stopping my BC effected my meds and the way they work. 

Maybe Wellbutrin is too much of a stimulant and I should try something else? Maybe I should just go back on birth control and deal with it since that combination seemed to be working fine? How the fuck am I supposed to distinguish between normal hormonal changes and hypomania? I hate this bullshit, and I’m so sick of worrying about what’s normal and what’s not."
Starting Lithium for BP2...your experience?,"I (26F) was recently diagnosed with mild BP2 this past summer and since then have been having trouble finding a medication that works and doesn’t leave me riddled with side effects. Other fun part is I have many other chronic illnesses (rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, chronic migraines, and IBS) that have me on medication that messes with my serotonin levels. 

So far we’ve tried latuda, vreylar, and lamictal. The latuda did nothing for me but made me super hungry. Vreylar had me feeling like the flu and couldn’t sleep at all. And lamictal was wonderful. I felt like the best person ever, except it gave me a headache that turned into a migraine every single day. I couldn’t function so we went off that. 

I’m very drug sensitive so my doc prescribed lithium as our last resort before I do a gene test. What has your experience been on lithium for BP2? I see it’s amazing for BP1 but everyone has the tremors and potential acne and hair loss. I’m freaking out over here as I’m supposed to start tonight and I’m worried I’m in for a real ride."
One thing that keeps me from really losing it,Is I know they won’t let me have my knitting needles in the psych ward. So when it starts to get bad I seek out help. At least I’m getting better at recognizing when I’m manic.
"My cat named oreo! Always loves sleeping on my bed, never fails to cheer me up!",
"I didn’t have access to my meds for 2 days straight, so decided to draw how I felt during the episode. It was like a mix of manic-depressed-anxiety with slight delusion.",
Started new meds,"I posted here a couple of weeks ago about having to start up on meds again because of a really really bad low that I had last month.. I’m just glad I’m still alive. Anyways, I had another appointment with a psychologist yesterday. I’ve already been diagnosed several times for bipolar but this time she said I was BPD as well, I barely have a clue what that is tbh. I was wondering if anyone else got a similar diagnoses? After looking into it a bit I feel like it’s a little controversial. 

I got prescribed Aripiprazole, if anyone has any comments about that as well. I’m not too familiar with the medications anymore after going cold turkey off of lithium about 3 years ago."
Update on Med Dosage Issue and This Just In: I Hallucinated Abusive Ex Today,"A few weeks ago I posted about getting the wrong dose of Lamotrigine from the pharmacy. I was 99.9% sure and had another pharmacy check and they told me I was right.

I started taking two the day the other pharmacy told me it was the incorrect dosage.

Welp. Neither of us were right. It WAS the correct dosage, and me and the pharmacist apparently read the last digit incorrectly. It's a 6 that looks a hell of a lot like a 5. My psych was not pleased that I upped the dose on my own, but agreed that I needed a higher dose and wrote me a script for 200mg, while stating that he would have preferred to put me on 150mg first but since I had taken the 200mg for a few days at that point and hadn't experienced any side effects I should be fine.

Then, last Friday (I had been taking 200mg for about a week) I started getting a rash on my neck. Freaked out of course, then it was gone a couple hours later. It came back Saturday, then went away again after a couple hours. Same thing Sunday. Given the come-and-go nature of it and the fact that no mucosal membranes were involved (plus my psych only works Tuesday-Friday and I don't have health insurance so I don't want to go to the ER unless it's an actual emergency) I decided to get a pill splitter and cut down to 150 and watch and wait. Mood wise, I've been fine since I started with the 200 and subsequently cut down to 150, and the rash hasn't come back.


For the second part, I have to give some background and need advice on it. I was in an abusive relationship from ages 18-20ish and this man is the biological father of my child. I've since married and my husband is in the process of adopting my son. After a lengthy custody and child support case (during which I was pretty accommodating but demanded accountability for both of us - he had supervised visitation), BD decided he was done and hasn't seen or spoken to my kiddo in almost a year. And he never paid child support. Which is fine, I don't care. BUT, my ex is a violent and vindictive person and I've spent the last 4 years of my life in fear that he'll find me and hurt me and/or kidnap my son.

I was diagnosed in September and once I started Lamotrigine I felt way more at ease and was no longer paranoid about BD hurting me or my kiddo. It was around that time that BD asked me to have my husband adopt my son, which honestly was what we wanted all along but didn't push for it while BD was still in LO's life.

When my meds stopped working/needed a higher dose the paranoia returned. I was paranoid again that BD was following me whenever I drove anywhere. And apparently the paranoia bled into other areas as I was paranoid AF about the whole med pharmacy dosage debacle. I told my psych this at our last session (last week), and he asked if I had hallucinated BD and at that point I hadn't. The paranoia has lessened since I got my meds adjusted, but it's not gone.

WELP. It happened.

I started the Spring semester of school this week, and on Wednesday I noticed there was a guy in one of my classes that looked a little bit like BD. But way too young. Both me and BD are in our late 20s and guy looked about 18-19. The lecture hall is a concentric design so you can see almost all the other students depending on where you sit. Towards the end of lecture today, I glanced across the room and that guy was in my line of sight. His face changed into BD's face (kind of looked like an overlay that started translucent and got more opaque) with an angry expression. I blinked a few times and still saw him, then BD's face faded out and he looked like the real person again.

Clearly, I'm freaked out. Paranoia + hallucinations are symptoms of psychosis and I'm currently euthymic, so it's not associated with a depressive, hypomanic, or mixed episode.

The soonest I can see my psychiatrist is Thursday, and I don't want to go to the ER because I haven't hallucinated anything else (to my knowledge) in the couple hours since.

I'm fucking scared guys. 

Has anyone else experienced this? And since I can't see my psych until Thursday, what can I do til then to care for myself in the meantime? And does anyone have any idea as to what I should expect when I see my psychiatrist and tell him about this? I have the feeling that he'll put me on Seroquel as well, but I really don't know.

Thank you


TL;DR meds were adjusted, feeling paranoid, hallucinated BD's face on another person. Halp?"
"Rapid mood swings (CW: suicide, mania, depression, psychosis)","I was diagnosed with bipolar a year ago (ish). lately I've been experiencing really violent mood swings. not just happy/sad but as if I were in a manic episode one hour and then ready to take my own life in the next.

"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly."
Reminder: Absolutely no activism of any kind is allowed here. Any day.,"If you want to recognise an occasion, please do so by offering extra support to those who've asked for it, and by being a good citizen of the community, mindful of our tips and guidelines.

Edit:  In response to multiple requests, I'm adding a definition of activism here:  ""campaigning to bring about political or social change"".  That's straight out of the OED, we aren't making any special interpretation of it.

Anyone else feels like a burden to their friends?,"I feel like my only friend is tired of me. Honestly? I don't blame her. Dealing with a miserable fuck like me must be pretty tiring. Whenever I bring up the fact that I don't feel good or try to share something personal it almost feels as if she wants to tell me to fuck off lol I feel bad saying all this, she means a lot to me and I'm sure she means well but.. damn I feel really lonely and alone with my problems. Maybe I'm just whiny and selfish but sometimes I want more than ""Don't think about it, others have it worse"". Sometimes I feel like I'm the problem and just pretend that everything is okay so she won't get uncomfortable around me. Is it selfish to feel this way? I feel really alone."
I killed myself,"I was lying on my bed, and I did it. I end my life. Only I’m still breathing. I’m not alive anymore. I stop living. I didn’t kill myself physically, but I sure did mentally. I’m done. I’m only breathing. But I don’t know for how long. People want me to keep breathing, but they actually wish I was alive, and I’m not sure i could ever give it to them. I feel like I’m tricking them into thinking I’m alive and one day they’ll realize I was already dead a long time ago."
"I don’t want to kill myself, but I really wouldn’t mind dying","Fuck it, using my main, it’s not like anyone I know checks this shit anyways, so here we go

I don’t care, I just want to die, but I don’t want to be the one held responsible for my death. I wouldn’t mind dying in a car crash or dying to some illness. I’ve been having this feeling for a while, my life feels as it has no sense of direction, as i really don’t fit in with the world. I feel like everyone I talk to irl and on discord don’t like me, like they find me annoying and would rather me to not be there. I feel like fat, friendless loser who everyone dislikes to be around. I don’t want to tell people about this feeling, i don’t want people, my friends and family to know about this feeling. I want them to remember me as the funny guy, the sort of guy who really rarely feels sadness or depression, where life is treating him well and nothing can really being him down, I want them to remember by the mask I wear rather than my actual face. Idk anymore, I feel tired, I feel like what is the point of this little charade I play, wouldn’t the death relive me of all of this, where I can be truly me and happy knowing that nothing can bother me anymore. Idk..... I just wished I was dead."
"When my mom dies, that's when I'll kill myself.","I've seen a hint of what my death would do to her. It would crush her to the point where she'd live listlessly, and I couldn't do it to her. 

But I hate the fact that I will have to endure more years as myself. For as long as I can remember, I've wanted to be someone else. I was bullied growing up; a natural victim. If we lived in a more primordial age, I would have been beaten to death by the stronger of the village. It's puzzling to me that my ancestors have managed to survive as long as they did to produce the sum of all their progeny: a worthless worm not fit for the world around him. If I could go back in time and prevent my coming into being, I would do everything in my power to make that happen. 

How many more years am I going to have to endure whatever it is I'm made of? I've thought about joining the military to break me down and destroy who I am. Maybe it will finally break me. If I come out the other end, I'll know that I am worthy to live here. If I die, then I'll get my wish."
Does anyone know of a 100% way to kill yourself?,"What’s the best way to kill myself?

I don’t have anywhere to hang myself within my place. A past attempt with pills resulted in me throwing up. I don’t want to jump into traffic since whoever runs me over doesn’t deserve to deal with me. 
I don’t want to hear how it’ll ‘get better’ or ‘I matter’ because it doesn’t and I don’t. 
I just want to die."

Different Kinds of Suicidal Ideations?,"Does anyone have different types of suicidal ideations? Like sometimes you are driving and just think to drive off the bridge? Other times it is like a daydream, you catch yourself blissfully dreaming about drowning in your bath tub?

"I graduated cum laude with an engineering degree from a high ranked university in Dec 2018, and I've spent all of 2019 bedridden thanks to debilitating social anxiety and depression and I feel just giving up is the only choice I have","I was supposed to have been the 'golden child' of the family and make it big as a 1st generation college student. Ever since I was found out to be 'gifted,' that's what was pushed on me all throughout junior high, high school, and university. But instead of being my family's golden child, I'm left as a bitter disappointment as I've spent all of 2019 essentially in bed thanks to my unmanageable social anxiety that prevents me from operating as a normal person, something my family never bothered to address and they hoped I would 'grow' out of it. Well instead of growing out of it, it turned into a deeply rooted personality disorder that I struggle everyday with just to not kill myself. Don't get me wrong, my university had a counseling center and psychiatric services that I tried to make use of. I went through several different counselors, psychiatrists, and medications that I can't even remember the names of, but nothing helps when it's that far buried in you.

How well you do in University does not show how well you'll do in real life. I only ever did the minimum - study and homework. I didn't have friends. I didn't do extracurriculars, internships, or research. Any free time I had I spent laying in bed watching something on my phone. I haven't even sent out a single resume at all since graduating because all I have on it is that I went to college, and that I know that I'm too nonfunctional to even be an engineer, let alone getting past a fucking interview. I'm probably going to have to settle for something like working at the local dollar store because that's all I can see myself realistically doing and hopefully not fucking it up. Each day, that degree loses value to employers and it's probably going to be worthless. Some golden child I am. I'm a complete lost at what I should do other than giving up and dying."

as desolate...  
as hopeless...  
as disappointed... ... ...  
in this life...  
in people...  


And then I realize how little chance there is of that, upon writing it... The next line I'd be tempted to write, for the sake of being poetic, would be ""not as disappointed in myself""; however, I find that I am not disappointed in myself...  
Others make me want to believe it is myself I am disappointed in, but I am not. I'm proud of who I am, what I am, and we largely have no control over *what* we are... I'm finally alright with it. I don't have any real complaints. The only thing I am disappointed in myself for, at all, is having hope in people, in a humanity that I long ago chose to stay away from for a very good reason...

I do not mesh...

I don't mesh with humans.

And I no longer care if I sound alienating, because you, reading this, probably shouldn't feel that way. I'm not thinking of you. I don't know you. For all I know, you're actually alright. The people I've had the pleasure of meeting, however, are not people I am very proud of. I see a lot of love, a lot of compassion, a lot of hope and even will to be better, even be the best... But they fall short in such great ways that leave me so perplexed... It looks so easy from here. Judgmental, yes, but I've taken time to think... I know of many places where I myself am lacking. I understand it because I'm me. It's easy. For others, I have to take more thought. If I don't understand it, I can't speak of it as if I do, and therein lies the problem — I do understand it... They speak loudly enough, both with their words and their actions. And they show me that they are aware...fully aware...of what they do, how they do it, what they can do to be better for themselves and thus for others as well... And they falter... They falter on purpose. It's intentional and it's knowingly.

I wouldn't be able to live like that.

And... After being around people like this... It's brought down my own will as well...

It's hard to love someone who doesn't love themselves.

It's hard to be convinced by them that you are stupid for wanting to analyze them and life as a whole with the intention of fixing it...so convinced...through repetitive action...being ignored as a means of punishment...and then, in the end, to be told the very thing that they need to be told...

""You can't love another until you love yourself first and foremost.""

There are many ways I agree with this quote.

The main way that I disagree is when it is said towards me...because I know, inside, that I very much love myself. I can even have an ego. And it isn't out of compensation for a side of myself that I hate. I used to hate parts of myself, and I chose to fix those parts. I came clean. I became an honest person. I started to live with integrity...

The second way that I disagree with this saying is because of my experiences in life... I have found that I have felt some of the greatest love I have ever felt in life from some who have not loved themselves at all... They hated themselves... And yet, they loved me with their all. They would never stop short of showing me it each and every day. It wasn't needy. It wasn't compensating. It was a genuine love and a full love...

I'm not sure why I write like this anymore. I'm not going to impart any ""wisdom"" or knowledge to anyone because it is knowledge that is only applicable to myself and only worth something to myself.

Love is a killer...

Love is blind?

Perhaps...

It blindly swings a knife...

You have just as much chance at cutting yourself as you do at cutting another...

Love is a drug, and I'll take it, watching you sharpen knives, giving me hell, but I take it because I still have one good eye...

Lose that second eye...and you're blind. You pick up that knife, and you're swinging it right back at them. One can only hope that knife remains in the metaphorical realm and doesn't become all too real.

Most murders are a crime of passion. Killing oneself...? Oh, that's the biggest crime of passion of all...whether you love or hate yourself...you're stuck in this physical form...

And some of us just want the fuck out of here...so badly...

Someday...

Someday, I'll make the choice...

I'll take stupidity over pain.

It's a choice to stay alive.

""The definition of insanity is to do the same thing, over and over, and expect different results."""
My cats are the only thing keeping me alive,"I’m so tired of being in pain and I really don’t want to be here anymore. My cats are always by my side and adore me. If it wasn’t for them, I would figure out a way to end my life. I just think how confused they would be. Maybe they just love me because I feed them, but right now it’s enough to keep me going. I don’t know if it will be enough for much longer. I just know I would never want to let them down."
I wish i was there instead of him,"Kobe didn't deserve that, wish i was in his place."
Help. Please.,"I'm 23. I'm passively rude to people, basically a complete asshole because I'm tone deaf as fuck. I think I have asspergers or whatever it is I literally am completely tone deaf and it makes me offensive. I got clean off drugs, for a few years now, but I have a problem where I just can't find love. I've been alone my whole life... every time I like a girl and she likes me, we hang out and have sex, but the sex is not super good for her and I feel like because of that I'm never an option for long term relationships. I don't know if I want to be alive if no one will ever love me. I have a lot of self harm problems with cutting myself since I was 13 and just recently relapsed cutting my self with glass and ended up falling asleep with a bloody hand. I want to kill myself and I visualize it everyday. The only reason I haven't is because I want to make a lot of money and help the world, so that I can kill my self when I finally because of worth. I feel like no one. I can go on for hours but I don't think that will help. I just want the pain to go away. My heart is constantly an anchor and I start having panic attacks and gasping in pain when I'm in public. It's embarrassing. I wont ever be happy. I want to die. so much."
I hope death is like sleep.,So I can just close my eyes and disappear forever.
I have NO ONE to live for,"I have no body that cares abt me and nobody I care abt enough to stay here, I try and try to be optimistic but I just can’t. People always tell me that it gets better but every day it just gets worse and worse and there is absolutely nothing I can do abt it. Therapy and counseling does nothing and I just don’t know what to do. I don’t know what is keeping me from killing myself already. I get no real support from family nor friends. I lose sleep every night from crying until I’m puking. I don’t know what to do at this point and I’m scared for my future if I even have one."
I just want to be happy and not feel alone,"I just want to be ""normal"" but I am not I didn't get to enjoy my childhood. 

I hardly had friends as a child, I didn't get friends until I was an adult and they are hardly friends I reach out to them and they don't reach back unless it benefits them. 

I am hardly around people so I never been good at reading social cues. 

I don't fully know what appropriate or inappropriate to say I have a really bad filter and I don't know what to filter out and my mom's always on me about it I am 22 so I should know by now but don't. 
It makes me feel bad because I am an adult, I should know better but I don't.  
I don't know how not to be awkward or weird. 

One of my younger sisters socially inept, but the rest of my siblings are socially adjusted. 


I didn't start dating until I was 19 and this affected me somewhat. 
I only been in 3 relationships so far and they all ended somewhat misfortunate. 

But my current relationship that ended really screwed me up because I didn't know what I did and he just ghosted me. 

I feel horrible about it, I really like him. 
I am very emotionally broken, I can't keep it together at all. 
I randomly just get emotional and I start crying and the other day I was sent home early from work because I couldn't stop crying. 
My mom sent me out for a few hours because I was annoying her with my crying. 

My parents were never kind to me about cry and make me close up emotionally recently I started expressing my emotions and feelings again. 

My former boyfriend didn't want to return my messages or call and thought the best option was just a ghost me and not tell me what was going on. 

Which was very horrible cause when he did last see me he knew that I was in a very bad depression rut, this whole situation just made it worse. 

I don't like self harming but it seems like the only thing that helps at the moment. 

I feel so bad I want to die. 
The worst part it seems like no one will miss me, if they don't miss or think about me while I am alive they sure as hell won't when I am dead. 


I don't want to hear it gets better  because it doesn't. 

Everytime I find happiness or something that makes me happy I lose it or it doesn't bring me joy long."
"i want to die again, but i don't have anything to be sad about anymore","i'm so confused. i'm happy. everything is going good in my life, i'm starting to feel better about my appearance, but the urge to go and lay down in the snow and freeze to death is overwhelming. i'm not even sure why i'm posting here, because i know damn well i don't have the guts to do it. i guess i'm hoping i can talk myself into it or something."
I've qualified for a handgun permit. Yay!,"All I have to do now is get my address updated, pick the thing up and I'll be done with the bureaucratic part of getting a gun. So that I can kill myself the right way. In a way that will actually work, but won't completely blow my head off like a shotgun will.

I used to think that if I got a decent job and got to move out on my own I'd be happy. Like I'd become a different person. A person I'd actually like to be. Someone who can make friends. Like real friends, close ones and girlfriends. Not just getting along with people at work.

Looking back I've been doing this all my life. High school sucks and people are shallow, but it ends and it will get better I used to tell myself. Then it ended, I went to college and I was still a lazy coward. I blamed still having to live at home with parents to save money. Can't get a girl if you have to take her back to your parents place to do anything right? Yeah, that's the excuse I told myself for never trying at all. 

Then that ended and now I live alone. I have a respectable job that supports me. Same deal, still alone just like always and honestly much fewer ways to meet people, women especially, than when I was in school. But that's not the problem. That's just a new excuse. The problem is me. The lazy, depressed for no reason sack of shit I am. The problem is I won't try, because I'm lazy and afraid.

I could try dating apps, but do I? No. I sit alone in my house, this place that I used to be so happy to have, but now feels like a prison that I confine myself to; just like what happened with my job. I pine after the idea of having a girlfriend or friends to hang out with as if that will be the thing that makes everything better. I bitch about it online like I'm doing now. It's probably a blessing that I'm so intimidated and don't try because being with me would probably be awful. I'd become a terrible boyfriend, just like I became a terrible employee at a job I used to care so much for. I'll probably get fired soon. I kinda hope I do.

It doesn't matter. I'll learn to hate any situation I'm in and anyone I get to care about me will suffer seeing me suffer for stupid, nothing reasons.

I don't want to drag myself into work everyday and do that boring job for the better part of the day, so I can go home and distract myself with a game I don't care about or some movie or show. This isn't the life I want to live, but it's the best I know how to get and at this point all I really want is to just go to sleep and not wake up. 

That won't happen to a healthy 24 year old, so I'm getting the gun. I really, really hope death is oblivion, but even if it's not then I have to die at some point, so why not go ahead, die quickly and spare myself and everyone else the part where I have to live?"
About to harm myself,Please comfort me i’m in so much pain
My boyfriend left,And I can’t deal with the pain. I’m not good enough. I just want to sleep and not wake up.
My Lifelong best friend attempted suicide and I don’t know how to help,"Yesterday, I told him I was coming to town without any prior notice and would be there later at night if he wanted to hangout. I didn’t get a response so I showed up to his house and called him when I was outside and he came out and just hugged me and started crying. I thought it was weird but as both of us were recently broken up with I figured it was just that. We go inside and he tells me that he doesn’t wanna live anymore, he sees no way out of the hole that he feels he is in, and he attempted to end it all the day before. Thankfully his dad happened to come home and caught him in the act. That night was the first time that I’ve ever seen his family acting like they care about him. After he told me that, my natural instinct was to tell him he needs help and to talk to a therapist or doctor or whoever is a medical professional. I also gave him some “tough love” by telling him how upset that would make me and his family. I said a lot of good things too but after some research and reading on some of these subs I realized I went about it the wrong way and probably made him feel worse. He ended up staying the night with me and his mom and dad were texting me through the night to check in.  I had to leave for a trip today without him even though he really wanted me to stay. I’ve been texting him but I’ve been looking for the right words to actually help him and came up with this draft “I don’t think I acted right yesterday when we were talking about how u feel. I don’t understand and can’t really relate but I want to. I want to help u feel better and it hurts me that u think so poorly about urself. I don’t think u believe it can get better and I think that’s why u keep shooting down my suggestions of ways to help urself. I won’t make those suggestions anymore until ur happy with my level of understanding of the shit u have been through. I won’t judge anything, I’ll never be angry at u or hate u, and I promise to whole heartedly listen and focus on understanding rather than just searching for solutions. Like I said I don’t understand and can’t truly relate but I will go through this with you and I wouldn’t have it any other way”
 Can Anyone help me with maybe finding the right words and some advice on how to help. For some context, we’re both 22, he is getting over a cocaine problem(or tells me he is), his family is not reliable to get him the help he needs and only began to act like they care after his dad caught him attempting. His girlfriend not only just left him but is obviously doing her best to hurt him, and we live 2 hours away from each other and see each other maybe once a month or two. Last night when I suggested help he kept shooting it down so I called a suicide hotline on speaker(he was okay with this) and I just told them my situation without putting any legit names or info in the description. I told them he wants to kill himself and doesn’t believe he can be helped and I asked the hotline dude to give me some information on what they do to help so he could hear it himself. It didn’t do much but I feel like it helped a little. Please help me i can’t lose him. I feel like nothing else in the world matters after learning of this. it’s clear to me that he still plans to end it, he’s just been delayed. Breaks my fuckin heart, help"
the only thing that gives me comfort is the fact that i will kill myself soon.,it’s like breathing oxygen that’s not there
I can't do it,"I can't do it anymore. I can't be with people and I can't be alone. I have no friends, kissless virgin at 21. I've been bullied BRUTALLY by classmates and teachers and colleagues and bosses since I was eleven years old. I'm HF autistic, verbal, but by god I may as well not be. I haven't had a real friend in a decade, it's been a fucking DECADE since I've felt like a normal person, half of my life. I don't feel human. I know it's ridiculous but I just feel like I'm not a HUMAN BEING. I'm treated like nothing but an animal and I'm starting to feel like I'm not better than one. I build relationship for MONTHS with people online and as soon as we meet in real life, it's all over. I can't interact with people. I was part of a karate dojo for a year and a half and they were the first people in so long I genuinely considered friends and then one day when the owner's wife said she didn't like me EVERYONE. Turned on me. So fucking fast. And I was never allowed in again. Everyone got rid of me on facebook the second it happened. I never even got a reason why. What happened, you ask? I moved out to live on my own for a couple of months. I told the owner this and he said it would be best that I never come back. Why? I don't know. He blocked me on facebook right afterwards. No one would tell me what I had done. I can spend over a fucking year building relationships with people and lose them in a day. Over NOTHING.

""Talk to people"" ""Go outside"" ""Make the first move"" ""Find hobbies"" ""Ask people about themselves"" ""Smile"" ""Believe in yourself.

The same crap day in day out. I've done everything I could possibly do with more people than I can count and nothing has ever come of it. I'm completely alone. I can't tell my mother because she's close to a mental breakdown as it is. I can't tell my father because he's an abusive alcohol shithead who cares about no one but himself. I can't tell my little sister because she already sees me as a complete failure. I have no friends to talk to. I can't get therapy. I've tried so many medications. And you know what the worst part is? The worst part is that I'm always getting better.

I've changed so much, from an autistic, overweight mute with bad skin who didn't even brush her hair to a completely unrecognisable person. I've learned to talk, act, even think like a real person. I live on my own I live completely clean I'm kind to everyone even the ones who treat me like garbage I go out every day I wake up at the same time every morning I eat healthy I excercise I talk to people every day. And you know what? None of it has made a difference. None of it. I'm still in the exact same place I would be if I had stayed that pitiful runt I was at aged 11, when my parents thought I'd have to live in care. None of it has mattered. None of the pain and the suffering and the bravery and the determination I put in to become a better person has mattered in the slightest. So why do I bother? Why do I push myself like this? NOTHING. I. DO. MATTERS. No one wants to be around me. No one treats me like I'm real. I'm still alone. I always will be."
I wanted to draw a picture,"I had the idea in my head. I saw it all perfectly. The beautiful people, the epic landscapes. It was gonna be great.

I started drawing the first line. It was good, I was definitely on point. This was going to be great.

I continued drawing. Adding here and there. Something on the left side, something on the right. It all felt great.

At one point I stepped back and looked at the whole. It.. wasn't exactly what I had expected. It was OK. But.. Well, screw it, I can work with this, I thought. It'll still be great when I finish it.

So I continued. Adding details, fleshing out ideas. I got bogged down in details. I tried improving areas I didn't like.

I felt better, but it still wasn't what I had hoped for. Maybe if I work some more on the area, it'll get better. I can do some work over here, that'll fix the other problem.

The more I worked, the more I tried, the worse it got.

Finally, I crumpled up the paper, and threw it in the trash.

I just wanna start over."
Oding tomorrow :-),
Life is so boring,"Nothing really affects me. It’s all just passing by. I have no real connection to anything anymore; Nothing feels real, everything is bland and so, so boring. It doesn’t have any worth. It has no purpose. I eat, I sleep, I wait for the day to be over. I‘m emotionally drained and exhausted, and yet there‘s still a looming presence of despair, sadness and dread all the time. Killing myself doesn‘t seem scary anymore."
I don't want to feel like this anymore,"I don't know how to explain how I feel anymore. I don't really want to die, but I don't want to live the life I'm living right now. But every pathway I look at to escape this way of life either doesn't seem possible or is such a huge step that I might regret it. most of the stuff I hate about my situation doesn't seem that bad from an outside perspective. There's just so much shit I hate about my life I can't even begin to write it all down. I just wish I could start over. And I know I can't blame anyone for how I'm feeling as I know that's completely unfair but I can't help but always think of how much happier I would be with different parents. I hate the way they decided to raise me. I'll tell them how I feel and they may try and help, but shortly after they'll go back to their same ways of parenting that made me this low to begin with. My dad doesn't seem to care about what makes me happy. Every fucking night he always tells me about something I'm doing wrong. Saying I'm ungrateful for what he's given me and that I'm lazy and a punk. It's almost funny how much he tells me how much better I have it then he did and how I'm nothing compared to what he was like as a kid. I don't know there's too much shit going on through my brain to write in one post so I don't even know why I wrote this."
do you ever feel like...,"the days are blending together 
the time is runing fast
no one got the time to hear you out
no one is understanding
no body to share your life with
the sky looks dark
everything in your eyes looks hollow and meaningless
even tho you used to believe in yourself
now you don't know who you are 
you can't separate between reality and dreams...
you feel like your heart is beating fast getting out of your chest sometimes
and times you feel so cold and heavy you can not lift a finger...
you can't trust anyone because everyone failed you and you failed them
you might used to believe in god and stuff but now you just feel like he really can't hear you out screaming...
the times were you felt normal and happy in the past now doesn't feel real to you anymore
you always feel like a burden to others
a waste of space...

you see the wars and the kills around you and think about how crule and cold we really are

selfish and self centered creatures we can't deny the ugly truth...
and at the end you can't take all of this anymore so you snap and try to end it all"
Friends tough love backfired and just feel worthless,"I spent a good twenty minutes crying from the conversation. I know they where only trying to help, but I feel worse and worse. 

Being told you don't know how to love someone properly by a friend hurts. Even when you yourself know it. I don't want to get of bed in a hour to get ready for school.

I just want to die. I've been panicking, unsure of what to do, what to think. I feel so empty and one in the world."
It doesn't feel great when you're suicidal qnd peopel you know or around you die,"October my fav singer killed herself. 

November her best friend (a singer too) committed suicide. 

December one of my coworker (I didn't know him directly) died because of heart attack when he was working at late night, no one knew until next morning. 

January a son of my mom's friend died in his sleep because some disease that he tried to hide from his mom. 

I want to die nearly every single day of my life. But I'm still alive and watching people around me dying. Jealousy definitely made way in my mind everytime someone dies."
I want to.,"Die. I've been dealing with my problems alone all my life. Now its just getting worse. I've gotten myself into self harm. And now I don't want to stop. I want to go all the way. End it. Why cut when I can just stab myself. I'm using a knife anyway. Besides, I'm worthless.. just a waste of flesh and bones."
I need to get things off ny chest.,"Sorry if my grammar and spelling are incorrect I'm writing from the heart. My boyfrend is just not the right person for me I realized this just now after an argument, he always insult me, basically mental abuse.. but I seem to can't let him go because we did have some good times, I've been with him for 7 years..but the mental abuse has caused me to feel as if killing myself was better off for me. He has even said I should... I feel lost rn I'd love hear that everything is fine I will be fine without him 😪💔😶 pls don't judge me I'm a mess rn and shaking at this point.."
Exhausted all day everyday,"I wish I could trade my life for someone who needs it, I just want eternal sleep. I don’t want to bother achieving goals anymore, nobody likes talking to me I’m everyone’s least favorite friend all the girls I like ghost me, or just ignore me. Feels like I’m dying of loneliness. :("
An online friendship has pushed me back to depression and suicidal thoughts,"We started talking because I used to post on NSFW subs. It's been roughly two or three months, and while he's very sweet, he wants to talk 24/7. I have so much going on in my life right now, that I'm only talking to close friends every week or so, let alone a fairly distant online one. He gets very upset, we get distant, barely talk, start up again, and the cycle repeats. I feel like such a failure as a friend. Even though I've explained that talking so much gives me crippling anxiety, that opening messages makes me want to throw up. That our (nsfw) relationship, while I enjoy it, is hard, because I can barely look at my own body without wanting to cry. He tries to be understanding, I think. But he just gets mad. 

He said I was incredible, but I keep letting him down. This just keeps happening in my life, in different ways. I don't want people to know I'm horrible, that in such a mess. I don't want to end up a burden like I am. 

I'm so done. I want to remain a good person in people's mind without fucking it up as always. I want to die fairly successful. Since I'm trying so, so hard to be the beat to others, and I really do think I'm doing okay, bit it's just not enough. My all isn't enough. So... I don't know. Death may be the last way to do so."
I want to kill myself right now.,I don’t want to deal with the immense deafening sound of loneliness. I know that there are people there for me but I just do want to fucking be alive. I don’t. I don’t want to live to see another fucked up day on this earth. The sad thing is I’m so young. Even if I did continue going I’m just gonna feel like this for the rest of my life. I don’t wanna feel anything anymore. I’m just so scared but this pain is unbearable and no amount of pills or support is going to help me at this point.
"I fucked up, can I just die in my sleep now?","I want to apologize if this post is poorly written, I usually write pretty well but I've been struggling to be coherent lately. 

I made the decision a couple of years back to stay in this shitty little rural town. I thought I wasn't ready to leave, so I figured I'd stay and work on myself a bit.

Turns out that was the worst decision I've ever made. I even had adequate funds to get out of this place. 

During that time I've lost everything I remotely valued about myself and with our absolute lack of facilities, there's no way I'll ever get back what I lost.

No access to medical facilities where people don't treat you like garbage, no access to healthy produce unless you want to travel three hours to civilization and three hours back, no access to any music or art facilities to help me get back to what I actually enjoy. And no people really worth spending time with.

I hate my body. I hate my appearance. I hate that I can't sing anymore. I hate that I can't perform decently anymore. I hate that I can't dance anymore. I hate that I've lost my fitness and health. I hate that I've lost everything that I worked so hard to achieve. I hate myself. I hate what I've become and I hate what I've lost. I just want to die. I'm stuck here and I can't handle staying in this shitty town any longer. 

Why the fuck should I live a miserable life which gives me nothing in return regardless of how hard I try?

Like, I've got an adorable catto and some great friends that live (VERY far away) and I don't mean to be ungrateful but I'm sick of living a life I hate just so I don't hurt anyone.

Living solely so you don't hurt people is a pretty shitty life in my opinion."
Really considering suicide...,My dad is really abusive as in he yells at me (and the whole family) for hours about the smallest things. I honestly don’t know what to do about this (I have no means of moving out) and honestly just want to die to escape kind of not sure what to do
The longer I live the more I regret not doing it earlier,"Nothing really gets better imo. Just raking up more and more regrets. I mean it’s so cruel to experience more and more shittiness in hopes of a hypothetical happiness, at this point it’d have to be one hell of a high to make all this worth it. Fuck I don’t know"
Idk anymore,"Idk what to do with my life, I'm struggling to find my purpose. 

I have almost no friends and its extremely difficult for me to make them, The few that I have I literally have to lie to in order to make out that my life isn't just a wreck. I'm not really close enough to them and even if I was I'm embarrassed to tell the truth to them as I fear they won't stick around. 

I have nobody close I can talk to about my problems or even just get a hug from

Everything positive that I see makes me feel worse about my life. 

My education is being fucked up and its outside of my control, I haven't got a clue how I'll earn money in the future

I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't even enjoy playing video games anymore

I've pretty much lost my interest in everything I enjoyed in the past

Every day I feel worse and worse about myself 

It's not getting better either and I'm so close to hitting my breaking point

Why do I even bother"
idk what to do...,i recently moved out of my dads house to live with my boyfriend of 2 years bc i couldnt stand my dad anymore and since i moved out i dont have a car since my dad bought it so my bf drives me to work which only gives me like 12 hrs a week so all my money goes to rent and i can tell it annoys him and he has to pay for some of my expenses and he works a lot lately and has college and i sit at home and clean and watch the dog every single day until he comes home to play his video games or guitar and i still have to watch the dog and my dad texts me all the time about how i screwed up my life and my bf and i fight 24/7 because im so tired of doing everything and then i only spend time with him when we sleep or if he wants sex i just feel like a fucking waste of a life all i do is take up oxygen and fuck everything up i had a shitty childhood and when my mom left i got depressed and its been 6 years i think since i last saw her i think about killing myself every day i dont have any friends either and ive cut myself once i just wish i had the guts to fucking end it already because i cant stand living the life im living now im just stuck in constant shitty situations i just want to move far away and have a job and my own place and my own car and eventually be able to go to college but i keep applying all over and not hearing back and ive called several times but they cant find my applications or HR isnt available at the moment i just wish things would get better already also i dont want to be with my current boyfriend anymore hes driving me crazy and i just dont feel like this is what i want anymore like every day some how some way he figures out a way to make me love him less and ive tried so hard to make this work and i just cant anymore im EXHAUSTED
Death is everywhere,Waking up to tragic news makes it harder
high school is ruining me,"I really want to drop out of high school. I’m failing, i’m so behind, it’s causing me so much anxiety and I would rather die. I really think I may kill myself if I can’t get out of it. I know my family will be disappointed and i know i’m a failure but i don’t see myself making it past 20 anyways. 

what do you have to do to drop out? it’s legal in my state to drop out at 16 with permission from a parent, but i’m so confused on how you drop out. can someone please explain what I have to do to drop out legally."
"Dear universe, can I please die?",I can't take it anymore
Lost everything,"The past two years have been so awful... I don’t know what to do anymore... I lost all my money and the love of my life... I don’t feel anything anymore... I don’t want to be here. I can’t find love anymore, I still think about her everyday... nothing ever goes my way...."
Tomorrow is my birthday and I am fighting with the thought of killing myself tomorrow night.,"I am renting a bedroom from an elderly woman who is 60 years old and overweight and doesn't take care of herself other than taking pills/meds. She is diabetic type 2, high blood pressure and several other issues. Today she was fixing a roast for dinner and when I went to get my plate of roast and peas she said she is feeling weird and doesn't feel right. Last time someone said that to me they died a few months later. 

I moved in here ten years ago to get off the streets, before that I was homeless for ten years. past ten years I have tried everything to better my life and get my own place but I fail every time. I am on SSI for CPTSD and Severe Chronic Depression and Severe Social Anxiety. I literally can't work. 

I have no family, no friends, no vehicle, Bought a vehicle two years ago and got scammed by the dealership. Been trying to save again and failing at doing so. but living off 790.00USD a month doesn't give much to save after rent, lights, internet, food, meds, co pays to dr,s my other bills like credit cards etc. If she dies, I literally have no where else to go and no place to live and I can't survive homelessness anymore. After the ten years of being homeless from age 18 to 29 my body took a hell of a beating and now there are days I am lucky if I can even get out of bed because of the physical pain I am in every day. There is no way I would survive being homeless again. 

So if she dies I will be ending my life because I have no where else to go. If I had a vehicle I would just live in that but I don't even have that. I tried a gofund me but never got anything. I am on the waiting list for over 70 low income housing apartments but those waiting lists can take years. there are some where they haven't even opened up since the 90's or early 2000's to mid 2000's.

If I had a vehicle or a place to live I wouldn't kill myself, but I can't survive on the streets anymore and if she dies I am screwed. wouldn't be able to do it anymore. Might as well just do it now since I can't have a normal life and have absolutely nothing in this life that is worth living for."
Someone please kill me because I can't do it myself,I hate everything
I’m not going to kill myself,"I’ve been depressed and has suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember (I’m in my mid-20s now).  I’ve been having a bad week or two because I ran out of medication and haven’t gotten a refill yet, because I’m too lazy.

I went to a party tonight with my friend, and I only had a few drinks, but with my time off medication, it was too many.  Now I’m feeling really down and alone.  My heart hurts and I just want to die.  I’m not going to do anything, I know that this is all just my brain lying to me, but I want this feeling to go away.  Talking about it helps me sometimes, so here’s me sending these thoughts out into the void.

Hopefully they get lost out there and stop plaguing me. It’s only through community that I can be free of them.  Thanks for being there for me tonight.  Peace to you, stay strong ❤️"
One reason,Why should i be alive right now? Give me one fucking reason
My mom makes me suicidal,"My mom is extremely emotionally abusive to me and I don’t really want to live anymore. I know I shouldn’t take her harsh words to heart but I do. And it’s emotionally draining and my mom makes it so it feels like I’ll be trapped with her forever. I’m 18 and I’m still in highschool, but trying to make future plans is horrifying. Cause my mom makes it like wherever I go, she must be in the same state or town if I move out. And she guilt trips me about my plans about colleges to make me feel bad for making her stressed out by being too far away or she would hate living there. 

I feel trapped and that I’ll have no future. I’m scared on the daily because the smallest things will make her start screaming at me for everything being my fault. I feel like the only way I can escape most times is to just die. I’ve only attempted once but fucked it up and never told anyone except to a close friend just recently (I tried overdosing but ended up choking and vomited. I don’t even know if the random pills I grabbed would’ve worked). Whenever I think about killing myself, I always manage to scare myself out of it somehow. Either I’m afraid of it not working and I have to face the consequences or how it will effect my friends. I really don’t know.

I’m writing this because my mom suddenly is yelling at me, blaming me because our cats have a flea problem and have been for awhile. She wants to me to call the vet and is telling me that it’s my fault the cats are having this issue since I didn’t fix the problem before it happened. I broke down crying cause I’m stressed up since I have finals next week and I’ve been spending the last few days filming with people for a short film for a class. And the fact I’ve been more depressed these last few months. I’ve been a lot missing school and avoiding others cause I just want to sleep my days away. My insomnia is worse and I feel like passing out a lot. I’m crying myself to sleep every night because I fucking hate myself and I just want to escape my problems.

I just don’t want to live anymore. I know I’ll probably scare myself of any attempts and I want to see a therapist about it, but I’m not allowed to since my mom controls my life. I just want to go to art school, get a girlfriend who I won’t scare off with all of my emotional baggage, be with my friends more, get a job, get my drivers license. I want to do so many things but I’m trapped and I feel like I’ll never reach my goals cause I’m pathetic and scared. Anytime I’ve tried confronting my mom has turned into the worst situations possible. Borderline physical abuse, being abandoned for days, WiFi and phone service cut off, and more. And ever since my ex dumped and my friends have become more distant everytime I ask for help, I feel more alone than ever. 

I don’t know what I want to do or should do. I imagine dying a lot. I think of methods of ways I could do it. I’m just a mess of emotions and thoughts at this point."
IAmA 20 year old male who can't decide if he should kill himself," I really doubt I'll reach the age of 25 and definitely plan to end it by then, but at this point I don't know what to do. I feel like life is pointless, When I talk to people I just get worried about what they will do, I have constant paranoia, I constantly worry about things like breathing properly, walking properly, blinking properly and it's to the point I can't do these things without putting all my attention into them. I don't care if people will be saddened by my death, but there are some things I'm looking forward to in the future. The problem is I know that there will always be things I look forward to and I feel like they'll just drive me to keep going on with something I don't enjoy the majority of the time. That of course being life. I'm not even sure why I posted this."
I'm crazy,"I just feel like I'm going to snap. I don't deserve help because I'm faking it. I'm so close to slitting my wrists right now, but I'm just being dramatic because I'm just a little, stupid kid who got in trouble. It's not child abuse because mom and dad used and use a flat palm and not a fist. Its normal to flinch at literally everything. It's normal that hugs make me want to cry and lock myself in a damn basement for eternity. It's normal that I cut myself, hell, I don't even do it bad enough to leave permanent scars because I'm a pussy. I don't have an undiagnosed attention problem, I just mess around during class too much. I'm clearly not *actually* fucked up, so I might as well just end it all, as I won't anyway because I'm weak and useless, and clearly this is all just for attention and undeserved sympathy. I am not shaking right now, this is obviously not a *real* panic attack, I can still type things out! I've never been in a bad relationship before, it's normal in every way for someone to force you to have sexual conversations with them on the phone while you try to eat dinner. It's normal for someone to threaten to kill, harm, and starve themselves because you want to hang up. It's normal for someone to call you a bitch in every conversation. It's normal for your father to wake you up in the morning calling you a ""whore"" and ""slut"". It's normal to be suicidal, starting at age 11 and to self harm, biting yourself when stressed, starting from as early as you can remember. It's normal to tell your peers in kindergarten that you're stupid and horrible. It's completely average for your mother to sleep with you in bed every night until you have to move out because your 'not abusive dad' gets custody. It's normal for mom to come into your shared room at night and slam your moronic skull into the wall while your grandmother sits and listen to you sob in the other room, afraid to intervene because you could be taken away by your mother and so you could never see her again, simply because you were up too late watching cartoons. yep, normal as can be. If anyone on this godless planet cares enough to try to talk about it, then by god, please do."
I have been thinking of suicide too often,"I'm a 19 years old girl, since I was 13 I have been having suicidal thoughts often until progressively they have become more and more frequent to the point there is not one hour in the day where I don't think of killing myself. I had my first boyfriend last year after he knew all of my problems he just dumped me after 9 months and he still calls me for sex I feel used and I think that's nothing there's worst things in the world and I don't want to find them or see them. My family constantly tells me I'm useless, and you know what? They are right, totally right, but honestly I just can't find any reason to do absolutely nothing, my boyfriend was my last ray of hope because I found him soothing and he gave me peace of mind that I didn't find anywhere else, now that the only person I have ever actually loved or cared about has left me I don't wanna know anything if my depression was high, after he left me it just got worse and it has been months and I'm still here not wanting to go out, to see anyone. I'm just fucking annoying and I understand people don't love me or that they get so tired fast, it happens to me a lot actually, people tend to like me and then just leave me there because hey realize what I actually am. I just want to die peacefully and stop the overthinking. I don't want to face the rest of the cruel people in the world I know they are there and I don't want them."
Am I gonna be suicidal 6 years in a row? Hell no!,Which is why I'm planning on killing myself before I reach my 21st birthday
Being dead sounds so appealing right now.,Going through a rough break up and the usual soul crushing dysphoria. I hate it here.
I want a reason to stay but nothing seems worth it,
We die and the world keeps spinning.,I've made my performance in life and now it's the perfect time to wrap things up. Don't let that world swallow you like it did me. Peace out fellow earthlings.
Attempted suicide 2 weeks ago,"Drank, took a bunch of pills, cut myself as deep as I could, ended up in the ER, pills kicked in and was high as hell in the psych ward for 8 hours. Then I was put on 72 hour psychiatric hold (my hours didn’t count over the weekend or MLK day, so I was actually institutionalized for 6 days). It sucked really bad, but near the end I started to feel better. Thought maybe it was working. Then I was discharged, and I found myself worse than ever as I tried to pick up the pieces of my life after being hospitalized for a week. So. This is what getting help is. This is the hope? That was recovery? That place was the, “this gets better?” There really isn’t any hope for me. I never should have texted my parents. I would have been better off dead."
Really unhappy.,"I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. I drink pretty much every night in hopes that I will just have a giant heart attack.  I'm 42, and I have 4 kids.  I'm a terrible dad because I pretty much ignore my children.  I take them to school and events, but other than that I'm just on my computer or my phone.  I don't really know how to connect with them.  My wife is highly successful, and I am a stay at home dad.  We haven't been intimate in months.  She only wants to watch inane Bravo realty shows, and I have no way to connect with her.  Her job is highly stressful, and we live far from family, so there is no real support.  I'm just in some kind of holding pattern, and I've been like this as long as I can remember."
Emotional exhaustion,"So welcome to 2020, a year that already is beating me emotionally lifeless.

I have a broken foot, so I haven't been able to do something so human as walking. It's been six weeks and I'm not healing at all. Being mostly chair- and walker-bound forces a lot of thoughts into your head. 

I feel stuck, and abandoned. Like I need a safe place to just fall into and cry with someone I know won't leave me, but don't feel allowed to. Just pinning the tears back in place, repeatedly. I keep feeling like I need to learn how to deal with my insanity on my own, and it's making it worse. It's so disconnecting.

I don't want to end my life, but I want the living to end. Which makes me fear for the future. It's left to imagination at the moment."
My aunt got arrested for dealing 10 kilograms of heroin and I am pretty sure she will get death penalty in my country. I was already depressed. Now I am even more depressed,"I am devastated. She was the only one who helped me by taking me to the hospital when I was 16. I usually visited her and we talked a lot. I just got the news, I don't know how to feel about this. We are in a 3rd world country (southeast asia) and dealing more than 600 gram of heroin will get you death penalty. I was already depressed. Now I am even more. It's Lunar new year and I am devastated, truly devastated. Not only that happened, 2 days ago my mom's aunt died. And today we got another bad news, my mom almost got a heart attack when she heard her little sister would get death penalty. I didnt even know she was a drug dealer till today.

3 years ago on lunar new Year my great grandma was dead and I loved her so much. Every new year is so unlucky for us. I am so done with life."
"Have you ever been committed to a psychiatric hold for suicide watch? If so, what is it like? What happened?","I don't know if I am more scared of killing myself or more scared of what will happen if I aak for help and am committed to psychiatric hospital.  And it's mostly because I don't really know what happens when you are hospitalized.

Even if just for 96 hours or whatever, I have this notion that nothing will ever be the same afterwards. And not necessarily for the good. 

So for those who have experience, what's it like? Is a horrible? Does It screw up your life after? do you wish it wouldn't have happened? Are you glad that it did?"
I'm fucking pathetic.,"It's 4am when I'm writing this, have school on 8 am, I'm 16 and I feel like the worst thing to ever walk the earth. 

First semester in the new school was fucking miserable for me. The winter break has just finished for me and I already can feel the stress and fear of going out, meeting people, classmates, and being stressed as fuck on Math lessons. I think I'm just too fucking dumb for my school, even for fucking life. I got a few friends, I'm going to the cinema next Friday I still feel like the 5th fucking wheel even though they reached out to me about it. I feel like a fat, lazy and pathetic loser who spends all his time sitting behind a computer. Math for me is fucking unlearnable even though my friend from childhood is still in a class with me and he's a fucking math god. I'm even too fucking scared to ask him to help me with it, I don't even know how to study, my grades are on the edge, all my math grades are only 1's (F's), I even tried to correct some of them, but when I saw the test I just left the class and skipped the day of school (the corrections of grades are mostly early in the morning).
My parents really don't support me, they think my anxiety is some kind of construct that I just create for excuses. They can't seem to understand that I don't want to be a fucking Christian, when I skip school and tell them that i feel like a complete shit they punish me for it and say things like - stop whining, I'll throw your computer out of the window etc. I cry myself to sleep almost everyday thinking of ways to end my life and I hope I won't wake up. Music is one of the things that keep me alive I think, new album of my favourite artist is about to drop 14th February.

I could go on and on about how fucking miserable and dead mentally I'm but I think this will do for now. I may sound positive sometimes but I still think the ""happy mask"" latches onto me and even fucking merges with me. But inside I still feel like a fucking clown. Even now when I look around my room I feel fucking disgusting about myself. Of course I could clean up here but I'm that fucking lazy and always can't get myself to do something productive. I just want to erase myself."
I just want it all to stop,"I don't understand, I quit smoking,  fixed my grades, I got back in shape and made a new family. Why do i still feel like this. Why am I still so numb. Its suffocating. Its crippling. I just wanna be happy again. Why wont it stop. WHY WONT IT STOP WHY WONT IT STOP WHY WONT IT STOP WHY WONT IT STOP JUST LET ME FEEL SOMEHTIMG ANYTHING PLEASE JUST LET ME DIE"
"I dont want to do anything after i graduate, if i ever. I dont want to be alive. Lifes not worth living.","I don't want to do anything with my life. I don't want a certain job. I don't want a nice car or a nice house. I don't want to travel or do anything. There's nothing left for me. I used to be scared of not doing good in school and having bad grades. But things have changed. I'm going to be in 9th grade for the 3rd years because I don't care at this point. 
Not being able to graduate gives me more of a reason to kill myself. won't be able to get a job so I won't be able to live. I
I stopped taking my medication for a while because I felt bad when I missed it. My therapist told me it's my last option to feel ok again so I went back on it for a week. I talked more and stuff but I realized that I would be with my friends more and I was scared that I would find a reason to live, I didn't want that. So I stopped taking it.
I don't want to hurt my friends or family when I do kill myself, but I just don't want to be alive anymore.
I won't tell my therapist all this because I don't want my parents to know.
When I'm old enough to buy a gun I'm gonna use it. I feel like that's the fastest and easiest way to go out. I don't want the chance of living if I try to overdose. Buildings or something like that is scary as fuck. Guns are easy to get or find.
I'm 15 as of right now. 3 more years left. Not to long, but not close enough. I hope I don't back out. I hear stories of people who said they didn't think they would make it to 12 or 13 but are now a happy adult. 
I hope that's not me."
Hello,I just want to kill someone and die.
why am i like this,like i really really want to die but im too much of a pussy to do it myself like why can i get hit by a car or get a disease or some shit
I'm grasping at straws here,"Guys I'm a massage therapist and I have a client that I'm booked 2 months out with. I was sitting here seriously considering ending my life within the next 3 days, but I checked my work schedule and came across the client I mentioned. I totally could just walk away from it. But right now I'm trying to grasp onto whatever I can. Unfortunately that is literally all I am holding onto at this point. I honestly dont feel like I have anything I can hope for. And even if my future might be bright,I don't know if I'll have the strength to wait for it. I'm literally grasping at straws. Really the biggest reasons I've put it off for so long is that I don't want to hurt. If dying were easy I would totally have already gone through with it."
I don’t feel alone. I am alone,"I’m in “the prime of my life”, I’m in college, surrounded by people my age all day every day. Yet I do not have a single friend. I think people assume I’m exaggerating whenever I say that, but I literally do not have one friend. I haven’t for years. I don’t click with literally anybody. I’m mad at the world because of this but I know that it is also just my fault. Doesn’t make me hate my life any less, and I don’t feel as though it is in my control to change that. Imagine the effect *years* of being completely alone has on a person... I think it’s hard to fully appreciate how detrimental and traumatizing this really is. Feeling hopeless, really. Always."
i wish i had the balls to do it,i wish people wouldn't be attached to me so i could just off myself. but even then i don't think i'd have the balls to take my own life.
I am going to try killing myself right now.,Maybe it will work this time.
:(,I’m such a fuck up. I don’t deserve the air I breath much less the space I take up
Is it bad that the only thing holding me back from slitting my wrists is that I don't want my parents finding me?,"I’m stuck right now. I cannot breathe and I want the pain to end and I’m ready to die. I have my note typed up and ready. I have my razor ready, funny enough i still sterilized it like that is going to matter. The only thing holding me back right now is my parents finding me like this. I don’t care about myself but I do care about them and I don’t want to have to see me in the morning dead in a pool of blood. I’m thinking of running as far as I can and just doing it there. I don’t even know why I’m typing this right now, I guess I’m looking for attention because I lack it but I think it’s too late. I just want the world to know that everyone can go fuck themselves!"
I'm going to jump tomorrow and I just can't take this anymore,
I just feel fucked. (Throwaway),"I just feel really done and tired of everything, but I can't feel sorry for myself because I always feel like I'm just overreacting. I'm only 15, I've tried going through moods like this before, and they always vary in length. Sometimes it only takes a weekend for it to go over, others a week, a month and the worst I've experienced was about 1,5 years. I can't cope, and I feel like a real dipshit for even hating everything. I feel incredibly unlucky, but at the same time, there are so many people who are way worse off than me. It's like I'm berating myself and walking forward at the same time. I've somehow managed to make suicidal jokes and general red flags a normal part of my behaviour and humour, so nobody ever catches on. I don't know a single person I can truly talk to, I've never had a best friend, a girlfriend or even a strong bond with a family member. I just feel alone, and sometimes I feel like I deserve it.  


I'm generally seen as a confident fuckhead who's immune to being depressed. And I truly do act confident as hell, but it's just an act, I second doubt myself all the time even though I press forward. Every few years I look back at myself and hate the person I was, well knowing I'm someday going to hate the person I am now even more than I do so now.   


I hate the fact that I know I'm wrong but I can't change how I feel, I hate the fact that this feeling will probably go away in a week and come back another week later. It's just tiring, it's lonely, it's stupid and frustrating. I get tired of everything I do, I want to have intimate relationships with people, but I can't feel any special way towards anyone I know. 

I somehow manage to be extroverted and, I'm good at talking to people, yet I have no real confidence. I'm supposed to have a bright future, there's a decent bit expected of me, and I have high goals for myself too, but I just lack any motivation to fufill said goals. I'm always in on the banter when we start berating eachtoher at school, but I can't help but let certain things get to me. I always feel sort of feel like the bad type of ""special"". People look up to me in certain things, hell even admire me and seek my advise, but on a personal level, and the context of a relationship, I can't help but think they don't care much for me. I don't remember the last time I did something with anybody 1 on 1 outside of school or family. My family life is also a bit odd. My father never disowned me, I disowned him first after he threatened to do so to me. My dad and mom weren't ever really together, and at some point I realized that my dad didn't actually care for me, he wanted to use me for citizenship. Nobody ever planted this idea in my head, it was something I realized myself by the way he talked and interracted with me. My mom was never much of a motherfigure, the emotional role of my parents were replaced by my much older siblings, but they're still siblings. I've never really had a role model, nobody to run to or seek honest advice from. My most genuine bond is with my brother, idk how to describe our relationship, but he did some of the things for me, which a dad is supposed to do. He gave me ""The talk"", I had my first drink with him, and he has explained some aspects of social life and other personal skills. But he's still just my brother, and there'll always be that fine line.  


I'm a short, asthmatic, extroverted, insecure, unmotivated, lonely 15 year old fucking guy, who's tired of everything, but I somehow lack any desire to end it. I'm not indifferent to life, I just keep on being in this fucking cycle of self hatred and judgement without any kind irl support.  


I have online friends who know me better than my own family, yet I've never fully exposed myself, because the more I dig the more I find, and it's fucking terrifying yet it makes me feel stupid. Everyone experiences shit like I do, I'm definitely not alone when it comes to this terrible fucking feeling, so why can't I break free. And my coping only works for so long, I've never managed to enjoy a game or an activity for more than a year, slowly and slowly everything just stops working. Feeling happy is a rare pleasure to me, when I don't feel loney, I just feel fine, indifferent. The problem is just when I get tired of said feeling, just feeling ""ok"" gets strangely old and miserable.  


I really want a close connection to someone, yet I can't for the love of everything I hold dear, create one. I'm sort of grateful for said online friends for the emotional support, some of them even opened up to me about their shit. And it felt nice, talking about shit feels nice, finding comfort in eachothers shared pain works surprisingly well, it's just sad when you can't ever truly know the other person since it's over the bloody internet. I just really wish I had someone in real life who got me, who would open up to me and embrace our shared hellish, stupid and first world problem filled lives.   


I don't even know if this belongs here, because I am not considering killing myself, but I just want an outlet."
I can't take it anymore.,"Ever since the love of my life passed away on the 10th, I see no point in carrying on. I don't want to be here anymore because she's not. I'm so lost. I just want to be with her again."
I’m a dog abuser,I deserve to die.
"Im not suicidal cause of my depression, I've never had any other reason of wanting to kill myself until today, and it's not major. I wanna stop it before it gets worse.","Please don't read this if you are suicidal, Im not sure but this might make you feel worse so please don't.

Earlier today I found out about rorochan_1999 which I don't know if anyone on here knows about them, but it 2013 they livestreamed their suicide. And since I found out about them I've been trying to find the original video since then, but I've only been able to find a short gif. For some reason a part of me is extremely worried about not finding the video and wants to recreate it so people can see a video of it since I can't find the original.

I know I shouldn't do it and I wanna stop myself from doing it, I doubt I actually will and don't think I could recreate it cause of where I live but I really wanna make sure that I won't."
hope- getting better slowly,"""felt a little sorry for myself, today's the biggest holiday of the year here and why is it like this, why are we on self-imposed lockdown at CDC level 3 alert status, why do i miss my ex's family, why is there no jjigae delivery, why did pizza hut charge me a fucking exorbitant 5 yuan ($.71) for delivery, why is it 75 deg out, why are my tonsils kind of dry, why are all my friends either away or sick (non-virus related)?

realized then i should count my blessings. as ChenChen told me last year, if i were home with family i'd be chomping at the bit to get away asap and craving freedom. and i have good people around me, a semi-tame carnivore who is cuddly and only bites every so often and answers/comes when called, a relationship with most beautiful guy that will get better rather than worse, a kick-ass apartment, a little work to do (equals: pleasant way to make money) and lots of wonderful memories with lots of people and good prospects for work (3 clients to chase after as of today) and travel (confidential to Nicola: wanna know what a forced vacation is?) this year.

how many hate their jobs, their spouses, their lives?  
so many ppl i know.""  --diary entry from 3 days ago.

&#x200B;

One year ago today I was in a horrible place. All I thought about was how to kms, even wanting/anticipating to suffer the pain of doing so. Because I was in physical pain every day just by living, I wanted to hurt even more as I died. Thought of many ways on how to do it. I had majored in psych to see what was wrong with me- I self-diagnosed it as a milder case of quiet borderline personality disorder. I'd had the hardest year ever- I was away from home in a foreign country having run away to China, severed all ties with my family, missing my dad who had passed away. I was scammed out of his insurance money he had left to me. My apartment caught on fire when the water heater sparked somehow and I had to pay damages to the management, money I didn't have. In serious debt. My dog who had been my best friend for 13 years fell ill and eventually passed away as well. My work-from-home job was in a lull. And finally, my bf cheated on me and blamed me for it. I ran away to a different city and just thought about dying. I'd sleep all day and at night, walk the track at a nearby high school for hours after midnight, blasting sad music into my earbuds and crying for the ex. That was the BPD fear of abandonment. I would never meet anyone as good as him, I'd do anything to take him back. I'd run, telling myself I was running towards my goal of reconciliation with him, and my throat would burn and I would just sob my heart out every day. I cut myself often and watched my blood run. That was one year ago.

It's one year later. Some stuff has changed, some hasn't. Still in debt, still in this city, now we are having a virus outbreak. But now I don't think about kms for some reason. Life is not good- I need to pay back people and I still miss the ex, although I have come to realize I wouldn't be happy with him. But I remember how raw it was to dream of suicide every single day, and wish I could help others. I don't know why I am writing this- maybe I just hope someone will believe me that sometimes we can, mysteriously, somehow, automatically, just transition out of the thought that suicide is the only solution. Now, I have met a couple new friends. An apartment I love. A life/relationship coach. Adopted a slinky kitten with an attitude problem. Life just kind of flows slowly, but not angrily or miserably. I'm more numb than falling apart. I try hard to focus on work and progress rather than dwell on or imagine hurtful things that will send me spiraling down towards suicidal thoughts or cutting. It sounds generic, and I never intended to want to get better. I really just wanted to die. But now, I actually wish to be happy. This feeling, before I knew it, developed by itself in my subconscious.

If you want to get better, I think writing helps a lot. My counselor told me that we often interpret an action or words to interpret an entire situation, convincing ourselves that it's the truth. Writing helps me think out my issues and I realize I often think myself into some ugly boxes.

I used to think it was like water dripping into a glass- you can only hold so much sadness before you overflow or break or die. I still kind of think that, but meeting another person who was also deeply suicidal and clinically depressed, and also reading certain psych books, taught me that in the end we all want to love and be loved.

I'm rambling, so I will stop. I hope everyone finds what they need to heal their pain."
Rewinding and relating,"I posted on here a few months ago. Was struggling with chronic pain and was at my wits end. I’m doing better now, but sometimes i get flashes of doubt about living.

Example: someone I care about (I’m like a mentor to them) attempted a few days ago. It’s sort of my job to keep them safe, and man did it fuck me up. I felt right back where I was a few months ago and it was scary. I had never been on the worrying side of the scenario; I had always been the one my friends were worried about.

This really gave me perspective and it was an emotional experience - being able to relate to someone in that way. While I’m still struggling, I’m reminded how things get better, even when I thought the only way to live without pain was death."
Im a monster,I have spent my entire life causing harm to everyone around me. No one will ever love me. No one likes me. Most people fear or hate me. Even the people who hurt me only did it because they saw what I am. I need to die. I can't take this pain anymore.
"When the emptiness strikes, my common sense dies","Here I am, drinking once again alone infront of my Computer.

Another weekend gone to waste.

I dont know what to do. I have zero fun with anything. I dont want to play Video games all day but thats all I have. I am pushing my last 2 friends away, have been avoiding them for the last two weeks. I cant stand any company anymore. I *want* to be alone, I dont desereve friends. I have no one to talk to, on the other hand I wouldnt know what to talk about, its all pointless, a waste of time.

There is this wave of emptiness that gets me every evening. I cant focus on anything, my thoughts are everywhere but not where I need them to be. I want everything to end

Someone I have never talked to before unknowingly prevented me from committing suicide,"Hey, I just joined this sub yesterday to ask for advice. I was in a musical called the ""Addams Family"" and I was dealing with suicidal thoughts and I told myself, ""when the musical is over I'm ending it all"" I was feeling more alone than I ever had before. Every day I went to practice I sat and ate alone, I didn't feel welcome anywhere I went. My parents have always told me and trained me to ask if im allowed to do anything that involves another person, including talking to others, so I never started conversations. I had only 3 freinds in general and I sensed all three were talking about me behind my back. I felt so alone, and my father had recently yelled at me because I was in grief about my grandfather's recent death and that I didn't want to talk to anyone. So that accelerated my plans for suicide I had thought about my 3 options for commiting: via revolver, knife, or chemical cocktail. I immediately eliminated the chemical cocktail as I wasnt good at chemistry, and I'm not sure how much for lethal dosage. I soon eliminated revolver as I'm not sure if there were bullets in it. So the knife seemed like my only viable option.

I had decided to push it up to yesterday since I was alone and nobody could stop me and I knew that. But I would have needed to wait until after practice since if it failed somehow I would still be in the right.

I had wrote this message that would be posted on all my social media, all I needed was to press enter:

""My last wish is that you all realize your destiny. This is mine. I have been planning this out carefully for the final 3 years of my life. You may judge me for the acts I have taken during this great struggle, but do not feel sad about this act I have taken, that I will not allow.""

I did my usual routine when I get a 1 hour break and walked in the snow all the way to subway and bought some chips and walked all the way back. Then I sat on the floor alone and ate my cool ranch doritos, thinking, ""I would finally reach the end of this great struggle, I would finally be able to do something right. I was alone in this mission, and I would complete it tonight."" Then a girl I never talked to before had told me, ""OP, you don't have to eat alone. Come join us."" I smiled at her and picked up my chips and sat with her small freind group and we talked about social media, some actors we liked, and some funny moments that happened at practice. When the break was over, I smiled at her again and said, ""Thank you."" I had stopped considering what I would do to commit suicide, and started thinking on why I shouldn't. I saw that I for once, I wasn't alone, I might have freinds willing to help me if I had the chance. Although I haven't completely abandoned the thought, I'm more hesitant about carrying this out."
i'm sorry to the people who have cared about me,my mom was abusive to me growing up. and i haven't been able to let it go and i hold a lot of hurt even though she's nice now and there have been so many kind people in my life. but somehow i always fuck things up and isolate. trusting ppl feels like putting myself at risk of being murdered and the anxiety becomes insane. now i find myself alone with no friends or connections. and i just hate myself for how screwed up i am. my life is falling apart and i don't kno how i'll be able to take care of myself and not end up destitute. i feel like i've let a lot of ppl who believed in me down. how do i keep going when i am such a disappointment?
no confidence and feeling worthless,"how are u suppose to have any confidence when ur too depressed to brush ur teeth or shower? i haven't brushed my teeth in 4days now. my teeth is hurting but im too depressed to do anything.

if i can't even do basic shit, how the fuck am i suppose to live this shitty life? i can't do this anymore. im tired of it all"
living is not for me,i dont think being alive suits me. i domt have a purpose. im constantly sad and irritated by the smallest inconvinience. i dont find joy in anything anymore. i want to die. i dont know how im gonna do it but ill find a way at some point. im thinking of overdosing. i think ill fail but its worth the try ig.. i dont know when im gonna do it. life sucks
People only care about themselves when it’s all said and done. I’m no different.,"I’m a pathetic piece of shit. My life is a fucking joke and I don’t have anyone to blame but myself. I push everyone away because I’m a coward. I’m either angry or manic or else completely detached, at any given moment, everyday now. A deep current of loneliness is always flowing over all these feelings or lack there of. I’m a fucking idiot. Every time I let someone in they walk all over every fucking fiber of my being. I’m a fucking pushover and a coward. I just want to be loved in the most absolutely fucking pathetic way. I give love so easily and never fucking learn. I’m a fucking idiot to think that anyone would ever truly love me in that way. I can’t blame them. I fucking hate myself. I’m not even a person. Fucking loser coward. I wish I didn’t exist. This fucking cardboard cutout life. Why the fuck am I so fucking wrong. How the fuck did I never develop all these basic fucking human skills that I’ve been faking. Even terrible people have relationships and love. I’m fucking worse then terrible, I’m a FUCKING non-entity. I’m not even a fucking person. I’m pathetic and I’m going to die alone. In pain and alone. Fuck this life."

But it's just not enough.  I'm struggling just to keep my head above water.  I have no interests, no desires, no goals.  Responsibilities have been the only thing keeping me going.  I'm tired.  It's time to get everything in order so I can go through with it."
"Quit drinking, remembering why I drank","I’m an alcoholic with 32 days sober which is the longest ever since I started. I even got into AA. I planned on killing myself after the holidays (heroin od) but had a major public blackout on Xmas day and detoxed immediately... Did surprising well at first and got distracted from the suicide plans for a while by false hope that I could have an ok life  if I just don’t drink(specifically a good job, car, apartment and relationship) but the depression has come back in a bad way... I am pretty much destined to be a miserable drunk/addict and if you knew me, my family and my life you would agree I promise. Well anyways I can’t have a peaceful suicide because I’ve spent all the money I was going to use on drugs for the OD so tommorow I’m going to use my last 10 dollars and buy a rope at Lowes and hang myself in the woods behind my grandma’s house. Pretty fucking lame way to go out but holy shit man I feel like I died six months ago. I miss my home (west coast, currently living in shitty soulless midwest suburb) and it sucks I’m going to spend my last moments in this shit hole but it’s either this or wait till spring and take a greyhound to Chicago and drink myself to death on the streets. Second option sounds better for sure but I can’t do this much longer. I snapped at my mom and grandma at a family dinner tonight and I feel so disgusted with who I’ve become. I can’t be here anymore"
I don't know,"January isn't over and I've fucked up so many close relationships so I can go through with it again, but I can't bring myself to. I just want this all to end, but I can't do it.

Benadryl Suicide,"I went to the store and bought razor blades to try to slit my wrists, which turns out is a lot harder than movies make it look. So I went back to the store after doing a bit of research on here about Benadryl overdoses for suicide. I only got one box which had 48 pills in it which were each 25 mg. I was originally only going to take half of the pills, but I ended up taking all of them just to make sure I’d be a goner. Probably an hour-ish later (I wasn’t keeping track of time so I might be super off) I was sitting on my bed with my friend and some of my hair that was on the carpet turned into spiders and were crawling up the walls. I wasn’t scared, I was more confused. I turned around to avoid looking at it and I saw tiny circle shaped bugs moving around so I squished them with my fingers. My friend had noticed the Benadryl box on the floor and called an ambulance without me knowing. After the bugs is when it gets really blurry and spotty. I remember three men being in my room asking me a bunch of questions all of the sudden and at the time I didn’t know they were the paramedics so I was answering and going along with everything because they were just asking me about my life at first. After that I was in the ambulance and was super loopy and confused. That’s the last thing I remember. My friends told me that the whole time I was saying things that didn’t make sense and acting really strange. They said that at the hospital I was dancing around and making jokes. I woke up in the hospital bed and was still really confused and high. If my friend hadn’t noticed and called an ambulance would I have died? I’m tall but also really thin and took 48 pills so I don’t know. Everyone said that a Benadryl overdose is hellish and an awful way to go but I blacked out, so it doesn’t seem like it’d be that bad. I’ve been thinking about if I want to continue living and I think the answer is no but I’m trying to stick it out. I went back to the store and got three boxes this time just in case. I also got unisom so that I’ll just go to sleep instead of tripping to make it easier. I weigh 115 lbs so 144 pills of Benadryl would definitely kill me right?"
Been struggling with suicidal thoughts and just received word a friend took their life,"I've been depressed forever. The first time I remember vividly and strongly wishing to die/be dead was when I was 6 years old. I'm 34 now. It's never gone away. It's always lingering on the outskirts of my brain, even when I am happy. 

I had an episode a few nights ago, a bad one. The worst I've had in almost a year. I tried to do an exercise to pull myself out of the hole, by making a list of all the reasons that I should live. I could genuinely only come up with two things, which were essentially the same thing- other ppls feelings. (The other one was my cats)
My pros list had two items and my cons list had 4. No matter how hard I genuinely tried to at least balance that list, I couldn't. It's been fucking me up pretty bad because I essentially accidentally realized that my life is meaningless.

This morning I received word that a friend took his life last night. A young man, in his mid twenties. Handsome, with a good job and a nice family. Always had a girlfriend. Social. Outgoing. Had a twin brother that he was close with. Well liked among his peers.

I am so sad, sad that he was so sad. Sad that he was suffering. Sad for the loss of his potential. But... Part of me is jealous.

Part of me is upset that he had the courage to say enough is enough and I'm still pussy footing around with my depression and my dead end life.*And I feel so guilty about that.*

My SO is reeling, with thoughts of ""why? He had everything going for him"" and I said, maybe he was just *sad*. Maybe he's *always been sad.* Because that's how I feel at least... I know I can stick it out for the few and far between moments of fleeting happiness that life throws at us occasionally. But if your baseline is suffering, what is the fucking point??

Maybe nobody understands why you did what you did, Josh.

But I think I do. And though I will miss you, I'm not angry at you for leaving... And I may join you yet. 
Maybe it's wrong but I think what you had was courage, not cowardice. 

I hope you found the peace you were seeking."
I just wanted to live a happy life,"All my life all I ever wanted was to be happy, I've my whole life suffered from a very young age with abusive parents and years of bullying. A year ago I got raped by my ex, he forced himself on me even though I told him that I didnt want to. I kept telling him to stop, I ended up kicking him off me..... I never reported him since he was the only person who I believed at that time cared about me but I was deluded and stupid. I have literal PTSD now and every day is hell, I can barely sleep and I keep waking up to panic attacks. Certain smells or just people with a similar hair style can trigger a panic attack, even people slightly touching me can make my entire body shiver. Sometimes during the night I can still feel his touch..... I want this to stop so badly I'm literally crying as I'm writing this."
how can i go without breaking my boyfriends heart,i have a plan to kill myself in about a year or a few months. how can i break up with my boyfriend without letting him know my plan? should i get him another girlfriend so he’s happy when i’m gone? or should i just do it when i’m still with him? i don’t know what to do. i love him so much and i hate to see him hurt but i truly don’t want to live anymore.
What’s your reason?,"What’s keeping you alive? 
I need a reason to keep going so what’s yours
I’m tired of reading these depressive ass posts that aren’t fucking helping, it’s not that idgaf but the last thing I need to see is a “I understand” or “I feel you” or some shit on everyone feels this too. Besides the basic bs about the suicide hotline or therapy do something that’ll help. Post what’s keeping you going instead of why you want to kill yourself so hopefully I can fucking find my own reason and stop being so tempted with suicide."
"I know I'm not really ""alone,"" but that just makes the loneliness feel worse","I am painfully aware that there are people in my life who care about me and would be sad if I died, but somehow that just makes the loneliness I feel feel worse. I hate myself so much that I can't understand how anyone else can like me or love me. 

And while I appreciate the love and care I have, it also somehow is never enough. For example I have a big family that I know is there for me, but there are some friends and lovers who don't feel about me the way I wish they did. Somehow the care that I do have doesn't feel as healing as the love I don't have feels hurtful.

I also know that, no matter what, people move on. If I died, it's not like the world would end, even if my loved ones would be deeply hurt. Grief becomes more tolerable over time for most people. 

I don't know. Whenever my suicidal thoughts peak I immediately have images of my family at my funeral and I just couldn't do that to them. At the same time, I really wish I were dead."
How I can kill myself?,"I can’t use gun because it is illegal in the country where I live and will not jump off the roof because I most likely fail

Who else doesn’t want to go on social media for the sake of not seeing other people be happy? And who else doesn’t want to go on social media for the sake of not seeing the valentine memes either rubbing in how lonely you are our rubbing in how other people are loved more than you are?,
What is the meaning? Future?,"Hey guys, I am 21 and I think I have been dealing with serious depression for past 6 years. My life has been constantly same story going over and over I was thinking it would get better. More excitement and expectations I got turned in gradually more pain and feeling of dying inside, not knowing what to do, feeling empty, without purpose. All my romantical connections I got turned into disaster right after they started. Every time I felt like it was somehow useful so I would learn from them, but it does not look like to be the case. I am from dysfunctional family, my life is kind of a joke. I nowadays do not feel any joy from anything, only time I do not feel depressed when I am watching some good netflix or play games, but with getting older these activities start to lose their charm. I feel lost when I think about my future. I am studying university but I almost do not make any connections. I think my family thinks I am disgrace. Last time I had some contact with girl I was bit interested in was looking kinda good, but without saying anything she suddenly started ignoring me completely. 

I do not think that it will get better over time. I do not feel any joy from life. I do not see my future brightly. I am afraid of what awaits me. Going 9-5 job every day of my life sounds hella awful. But on the other hand I do not think I am capable of killing myself. So I was thinking about joining French Foreign Legion and maybe die somewhere in desert stepping on a mine, without anyone thinking I was a coward. But this is also taken away from me, since I have developed high blood pressure, so I would not propably make it there. Now I am here and thinking of ending it all afterall. I am sorry if this post is waste of time."
I’m slowly losing it,"I don’t know what’s with me. I’m usually optimistic and believe in living life but after looking through what happened to me as a child, I’m feeling hopeless. 

I’ve been depressed since the age of 8, it would come and go and for a while it has left me alone. I thought it would finally leave me be since I’ve grown more as a person and consistently watched out for any negativity lingering around my mind. But I think I let it slip. 

I was doing my stretches as usual and I suddenly thought “What’s the point of living here? What’s the point of my existence? I’m not important to this universe. No one would care if I died. ” I’m scared, I cut myself yesterday trying to process my memories. I promised myself last summer I wouldn’t cut again but I did. I promised myself I wouldn’t let my trauma get to me again. I promised myself I’d stay strong. Why did I do this? I have no idea."
Another miserable day at work,"I'm wearing a tie like my manager position at McDonald's means something. I'm miserable and i know it. I'm the odd one out. Why am i pretending to be useful.

The thing i do 50 hours a week is a joke"
I want to kill myself so badly.,"No one could ever love me.  I feel completely alone.  The future looks bleak and meaningless, I will never feel successful.  The only point of my life is to continue being a debt/tax slave.  I want to kill myself and yet people say it's selfish to want that.  It seems pretty fucking crazy to me that someone wanting to end their misery is seen as selfish while people wanting someone to live because their death would be a minor burden to them isn't seen that way."
Can’t do anything,"I don’t want to live yet I also don’t want to die. I wish I was never born. Everyday I want to die but I don’t want to actually plan out my suicide and kill myself. Everyone around me cares and thinks of me as a good person and I’m shit to trick them into thinking I’m a good person. I’m u grateful for being selfish and wanting to leave them behind when I don’t want to wake up another day. People say life gets better as time goes on but I don’t see it happening. Everyday is just getting worse. I have no financial problems or relationship issues or anything like that, it’s just me. I hate waking up as me. I hate myself. I wish I was dead. But I can’t die without making everyone, who dealt with my shit over the years, happy"
"No one will see this but if you do, thank you 🖤","I’m at home with my mum (who is asleep), usually my Stepdad is home too but I told him that my uncle is coming round, with even some false proof, he believed me so he has gone to his hour or two work shift. 

I did it so I could cry on my own, contemplating kms, because for years, since I was about 8 I have been thinking about it, getting stronger over time. I am always paranoid, looking around every corner, everyday contemplating. I just want it to end, so much has happened, people think I have it all, but it is all just a lie. About once a week I look up to see what the quickest way to kms is, to see if someone came up with a new and easy way. 

People say that I’m not alone, they all do, but these days I believe I really am, they say don’t do it. I have ambitions in life, but I know that I will never complete them, I will be gone soon and I know it, never having done any good except a few occasions when I made my family happy. I know what could have been, but now, right now, I’m a waste of a life and there is no reason to go on.  I suffer so much, I have no hope but I know things that I want to do in life, things that I want to see, places that I want to go to, people that I want to meet, but I am literally on the edge. They say call these numbers, go to these groups. They to me are worth nothing. I really wanted to live, but I can’t suffer like this anymore.

Sincerely, Kris"
Ya I start to not like good ppl because my thoughts around them are fucking painful.,"I wish I didn't have these doubts that make everything so blurry, in the end they just all hate me because I'm never enough and I'm a failure. My life is doomed also cause I was not accepted into the high school I wanted, and now I will never be normal of course. (All lies but these are my thoughts) I am now starting to dislike ppl because even though they are nice and stuff they are just hard on my thoughts and I can't keep trying to make plans with them. O decided if they do want to hang out like they said, they can go and hmu. I'm down if they are fucking willing sheesh"
It's lonely,"I'm so tired. I want to hug somebody so badly, and for them to tell me that it'll be okay, and that it really will be okay. I regret not being more social, or thinking through my life choices before i made them. I went with what I thought was right, but i fucked it. I hid from people for years, didnt want to be hurt.
It hurts so much more not knowing anyone though. They say no man is an island, but i've become a peninsula if anything. You can't stop what's coming, so why wait? Meet death on your own terms. Why try to suckle the marrow of life out of others? I am a parasite on others happiness. The world is so much better off not having a fat idiot taking up and wasting space.
I wish someone could come down from the clouds and just take me away to a new place, with new people, with a different mind. I don't want to die, i just want to be someone that I can never be."

Life seems pointless,"All I do is watch Netflix or play games, I have no friends, and family seem like strangers. I held a gun recently and I didn’t trust myself to hold more than 10 seconds it seemed like. Fuck this shit"
"I'm lost in life, because I didn't think I'd make it this far.","I'm 25, and it just hit me that I am 25. I don't have a career, beater truck, moved back to my moms after my divorce and lost everything. I'm alone, I have no reason to live, or anything to lose and when I say that I'm not joking. I deleted all social media about 8 months ago, I have 0 friends, 0 people to talk to. Literally, that's not an exaggeration. I know dying is what I want, it always has been, yes, even when I had a ""good life"". I haven't had the balls to do it yet, but the thoughts are so nagging. And i am so lost in life, not caring about anything, like getting pulled over for minor traffic things and skipping out on court dates because in my mind ""I'm just going to kill myself anyways"". I didn't think I'd make it to this age, my head screams at me everyday to pull the trigger, I don't know what my point was, just venting."
I cant find the fucking razors,I'm a little tipsy right now but the other day actually weeks ago my therapist had me give my razors to my mom but now I cant find them I looked in her room and I didnt see them anywhere I'm gonna look in the garage :( I just want someone to know I'm hurting...that I'm really hurting...maybe I could just take pills but that usually doesn't work ir I cut deep enough it will work though

don’t know what to do anymore,"I feel like I’m constantly in a roller coaster. One second I’m on top the world without any cares and doing amazing and the next second I’m spiraling out of control and want everything to end. I’ve written many many suicide notes in my 24years of life. None of which any one has had to read. I’ve had friends and loved ones die, and I wished everytime I could give my life up for theirs. I’m always questioning, why me? Why could I have just not been born. I can’t talk to any of my friends. They all brush me off or make me feel worse than I already do. The only reason I haven’t done it is because I know how much it would crush my family. And I love them more than myself. But I so wish it could be over. I almost got into a major collision yesterday — if I hadn’t swerved I would probably be dead right now. Why didn’t I just let the car hit me? It would be easier on my family than if I committed suicide. I just hope there’s a moment when everything is finally at the top of the rollercoaster and I get to stay there for awhile."

i get excited, it goes and it leaves me feeling dead again. i get angry, then i feel dead again. 

i feel dead. i don’t really know who i am.

Thinking about resetting my phone to factory settings,"There's a bridge with a pedestrian portion with permeable fencing. I want to stop everything and I don't want to incriminate anyone or leave anything for my family to speculate on. I know this urge will wear off soon, or I'll be able to rationalize myself away, but for now this is an intrusive urge and feeling I have."
"My fiance changed their mind on having kids, and the best possible way this could end is with me dead","When we first got engaged, my fiance (XY) and I (XX) were excited about getting married and having kids.  We'd decided on having two or three.  We picked out prospective names.  We talked about the things we wanted to do with them when the kids were little, how we'd handle problems, the whole nine yards.  But a few months ago, my fiance changed their mind: they don't want kids any more.  The reason?  They're trans, they feel like they can't/don't want to transition, and the only way they feel they can cope with dysphoria is by having an extensive appropriate-gender life online, and having a child would destroy their coping time.  So...that's that.

Ever since, I've been thinking about how this is going to go over with our families.  My fiance's family is very close-knit and traditional Catholic.  They expect us to have kids, and after a while of not producing grandbabies they will start asking probing questions.  My fiance thinks no one's going to ask (they will, they ask about *everything else*, they won't not ask about this) and that if they do ask we should just say that we've decided that we won't have kids...but I can't keep up that lie beyond an initial front.  *We* didn't decide anything, and the reason my fiance decided on not having kids isn't one we can share with their family.  The best alternative option I can think of is that we lie and say I'm barren (no one would believe my fiance is biologically incapable, big Catholic family there), but my fiance isn't willing to go with that lie.

I know that with my fiance's plan, my fiance's family will eventually decide that I'm at fault, that I convinced their child to not be a parent.  And they *will* take it out on me, and I don't think I can handle being frozen out like that for long.  If I died somehow--ideally in an accident, or some disease--no one would blame my fiance for not having children or staying single until everyone in their reasonable dating pool was too old for children; they'd just be a victim of tragedy.

I'm not thinking of killing myself today, or tomorrow, or this year.  But in a few years, when the questions and the pain and the biting comments and icy glares get too much, if I haven't gotten lucky enough to die first, I'm going to have to do something about it.  It'll hurt my fiance a bit, but they've got a stable-enough coping mechanism that I don't think it will be a severe blow."
Suicide seems the best option. Help me.,I'm a 19 yo guy. I have been depressed for the past 4 years of my life. I had a ray of hope when I started dating a girl. And just after few months into the relationship she left. I suffer from depression everyday. It's too hard to move on. I find difficult to connect with people. I don't have many friends that understand depression and try to help me. I feel lonely everytime. My parents just wants me to get good grades in college. I have been suicidal for a long time now. I don't have to guts to do it rn. But eventually I will do it unless I find some help to get me out of this hell. Hoping for some help but not expecting it :)
Agh,Ugh
So much pain,I just found out the worst news so angry and so upset I feel so betrayed tried calling suicide hotline and it took 5 minutes and no one answered I gave up I want to give up
Holding on,Today I am writing to hold on. It will be okay. I need to stay here to take care of my mom when she is old. I need to make sure I don't die before my gramma. I need to make sure I take care of my mom when she is old. I need to hold on. It is all good.
I just lost my mind over turkey salad,"I've posted here before, it's why I have a Reddit account in the firsts place. Also on mobile. I'm spiralling so fucking bad. I can't get the thoughts to stop. I wake up and I want to die, I brush my teeth I want to die, I take a shit I want to die. It doesn't fucking stop. I can pretty much manage during the day if I stay busy but at night it's so bad. I have tried to talk to my friends about it, but they all want to make me feel better and tell me i don't have any reason to want to kill myself or they want to play pain Olympics. I've tried talking to my not boyfriend unless he decides he is my boyfriend depending on the situation and he says that it's fucking stupid that I want to die. I just want it to stop and I can't make it. I've been wanting to die since I was 8 years old and I'm 25 now. I don't want to spend the rest of my life this way. It's so fucking scary because I've gotten used to it. My brain tells me to jump off the balcony of my work and I go it's only 2 stories it wouldn't kill me. When I found out about kobe and his daughter dying today, I was jealous! How fucked up is that?! I'm jealous of a 13 year old girl who died! I just want it to stop and I made my self a sandwich with the turkey salad my mom.made earlier and she asked what I was eating and it turned into a whole fucking thing and I didn't even eat the sandwich even though I'm hungry as fuck because I haven't eaten since 2pm and I'm not going to now because I don't deserve to eat now. I want to be held and I can't even have that and I just hate myself so fucking much"
I think i’m done now,I want to kill myself. Everything in my life keeps getting worst and worst. I’ve got no friends and I am just a disappointment to my family. I keep thinking about ways to end my life and how others will react to my death and it’s gotten me so depressed. I’ve cried everyday now since the beginning of the year. I just don’t feel like it’ll get better anytime soon. All my suffering and all my troubles could go away if I did this. The only thing holding me back is the consequences it’ll have on others.
I’m not okay,"Not even a little bit. If I’m being totally honest the only thing stopping me from swallowing an entire bottle of Xanax right now is knowing my daughter is asleep in the next room and the trauma of a parent committing suicide is an unforgivable thing to do to her. Her dad is in the next room, he thinks I’m crying because we have been fighting but the truth is it’s because I’ve spent the better part of a week trying not to do it.  The most ironic part of it is he posted on Facebook about a week or two ago about “reach out to me if you’re feeling suicidal I’ll be there for you “ or something along those lines."
I cant keep on living like this,"Honestly, my life is fucking pointless. I dont know why I am here, and why should I stay here, but I dont have other options. Im scared of hurting my loved ones, but I Hurt them all the fucking Time. One of my friends straight up already avoids me, and I have hard Time talking with other one. This even isnt the first Time and both times this has happened cuz Ive placed my trust on their hands and accidentally left my shit just flow. Therapy isnt an option, I demonize myself so.. I cant. Lately Ive been compeletly covering my shit, and just pretending Im ok, just a little bit tired, but that will not hold up very long anymore. I have test tomorrow and I havent been able to get myself to bother read to it. I dont bother keeping on track with my deadlines, I dont clean my room or take proper care of myself, expect I eat.. But try do it without lot of effort.. So just bread without butter etc. Cookies and meals what my parents make. I feel like Ive treated my loved ones fucking unfairly and Ive done everything wrong, Honestly id love to just run away. Just live In the forest all alone or some shit. I cant die, but I cant keep living like this. I need to leave, now. Or just find a way to change this shit, I dont know how long I can keep going. My writing propably is fucking messy, but I cant even keep track of my own mind tbh."
Suicidal/various mental health issues but not seeking treatment because currently enrolled in college. Should I withdraw and seek help despite the ramifications?,"This is my first post here, and I am struggling with how exactly I should express myself and format this. With that being said, I am looking for advice with regards to my current situation. I am currently a junior in college who is going through what can only be described as a depressive episode. I also struggle with anxiety, and I got help with that past summer. Now my depression seems to be getting worse; I struggle with lethargy and low energy and have a lot of trouble leaving bed in the morning. I'm also very irritable and have an extremely difficult time focusing on anything which is extremely problematic considering I am in upper-level English and philosophy classes. On top of that, I've been procrastinating on my studies which is compounding my feelings of worthlessness. I am also having thoughts of taking my own life, and these thoughts have been increasing as of late. I feel as if all my confidence has been removed from my body and soul. I also feel like one of the worst people on the face of the Earth; like I am subhuman and will never truly relate to or fit in with anybody; like I am fundamentally flawed. A round peg in a square hole. And I feel like and fear that I'm on a trajectory that ends with suicide unless I do something drastic, and receive help.

To the external world, however, I am doing great. I am currently working on my resume so that I can apply to Law school and I should be studying for my LSAT right now. I have a small group of friends and am in a steady relationship. I just was hired to be an RA next year in our dormitories. I feel enormous pressure to maintain these appearances, however, and I am also consciously aware that my mental health issues are holding me back academically and socially. At the same time, I fear that I could be setting myself back by taking a semester off (or some other drastic measure) to receive help for my issues; plus I know most people in my life would not be supportive of this decision at ALL. I would be met with derision and scorn, as most of the people in my life have already voiced their scepticism towards mental health issues. My friends definitely wouldn't understand. And I'm afraid I would be setting myself back career-wise as well.

At the same time, I truly think I am slowly deteriorating mentally and may need intervention to prevent me from going down a dark path. I am feeling more and more inclined towards suicide each and every day, and the thought of no longer being alive is enticing. Every day is extremely painful, and I don't think I have done justice to the pain I feel in this block of text. I just want someone to be supportive and tell me that no matter what I decide to do, I'll be okay."
im failling in college and in life in general,"january is the worst month of the year for me. i have had some traumatic stuff happen in the past and my worst relapses in january. now im having my first college exams and i've already failed one, and im gonna fail the next one too probably (its tomorrow). im not failling all of them, i was expecting to fail the upcoming one but the forst one came as a shock. i almost failed to even show up to my previous exam cus i was having a breakdown and also my boyfriend broke up with me 2 days ago after weeks of fighting and it was awful. i am disappointing everyone and mostly myself. have been falling back into dark thought patterns.

at this point i just wanted to get this off my chest because when i tried to vent to.my ex he basically said im just dramatic and immature for feeling like this amd it still hurts. i honestly dont know what to do with my life and i just want to stop existing"
What should I do with my dog?,"I have a 7 year old dog, she’s the only reason I’m still here. Shes amazing. I’ve concluded that it’s not fair for her to be around a dad who’s in such a terrible headspace. I really love her but the depression and thoughts of suicide are never going away. Sadness is all I see in the future and happiness is far in the past. I just need to figure out how she will be taken care of and how she can have the best life for the rest of her life? I’ve started to think of a plan and a timeframe, I just need the right opportunity.  I just can’t stay strong. People say suicide is for the weak and that’s fine. I just want out anyway possible. The way I look at it, I’m gonna die eventually and probably from suicide so why don’t we just get on with it? This is the only thing that I really care about figuring out. I’m very lonely and I don’t anticipate someone should find me for at least a month, so I don’t think that I can just leave her because no one will find us soon enough. It’s not fair for her happy life to be ruined by me or have her suffer in hunger or sadness. I just don’t know and need answers. She’s the only thing that I would feel slightly guilty about leaving, so I need to give her the best option. Thanks guys."
I hope to go surrounded by people i love,"Every day i fantasize about ending my life with prescription drugs when I’m with people i actually love. I’m too much of a coward to do it alone.

Memories of my childhood trauma haunt me every day and I’ve come to terms with the fact that i’ll never heal. 

I’ve been dealt some pretty bad cards in life and i guess it just is what it is. I guess I’ve never been granted unconditional love, only post traumatic stress and i find it truely sad how a life had to wasted. 

I don’t want to jump out the window, but the flames inside force me to."
I want to talk about my problems.,Hello I have been cutting myself for the past month and I keep getting deeper I don't want this but I keep doing it each time going deeper and deeper. Please help me.
How is life this atrocious at 21?,"Hello suicide watch, my old friend. I once again have never felt worse in my life. Where do I even start. I would start as usual with how hideously fat and disgusting I am but I feel like that’s not even the reason I’m suicidal this time. Maybe part of it, but not the overwhelming factor.

     Let’s start with my personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder, which is the root cause of all this and what brings me back to the brink of suicide month after month. Once again, I fell in love way too quickly and became obsessive. It’s time to be honest and tell it for what it is. Men control my life. They control how I see myself, my happiness, my self worth, my joy, everything. I scream internally when I get a new crush/obsession because I know it’s going to start a deep, dark downward spiral which only inevitably ends in contemplating suicide because the target of my affections is always someone unavailable to love me back in the way I need to be loved. I have been in therapy since the age of 16 on and off, tried several medications, been in the mental hospital three times, and nothing has ever helped long term. I do feel better for short spurts, but then i meet another man and the cycle starts all over again.

     The only good thing about this time around is I finally realized what is causing these cycles. It’s not even that I am trying to meet men every time I “imprint” on a new one. It could be as simple as someone I work with. Everything is fine and then one day...it’s not. I’m googling them, Facebook stalking, checking their snap score, LinkedIn, maybe even doing a background check. I’m certifiably insane and no one who knows me even realizes the extent of it. I’m an absolute psycho and the world would probably be better off without me anyway. I don’t see how this disorder can ever be cured. My brain is broken.

       Now let’s talk about my past. I’ve been raped more times than I can count, groomed by older men in my childhood, abused, beaten, taken advantage of in every which way. My college rape freshman year was the worst one. That’s when I knew there was no coming back. It’s like I knew I was going to destroy my life or die trying. I know I am smart and some days I envision doing amazing things, like studying public health at Hopkins. Other days I just want to jump off the Ambassador bridge. Today is one of those days. I am in so much emotional pain I can feel it physically and I can’t stand it anymore. 

      I also carry around massive amounts of guilt. My brother is headed to federal prison soon, and I can’t help but think if I hadn’t been such a shitty and dramatic sister maybe my parents would have been able to pay him more attention and realize he was fucked up too. My family’s broken up over this. I keep imagining the day he was taken away, and I can’t stop crying.

       It’s really just a big mess of everything at this point and I can’t pinpoint the one factor that is making me want to end it all. I just know if the rest of my life is going to be these cycles it’s not worth living another day of this misery. Thank you for reading this stupid rant."
Realizing it's permanent,"I've been considering ending it all for the past few weeks until today. Ive just wanted the pain to stop and to not be overwhelmed anymore and it's felt like that was the only option. It might sound stupid, but hearing about Kobe's death really got to me and made me realize how permanent that decision is.  

I'm still struggling. I still just want it all to be over, but for the first time I recognize the consequences of it and I'm scared. 

No more feeling worthless. No more anxiety attacks. No more feeling like a complete failure. But no more good times (no matter how infrequent they are). 

I don't know what to do, but I can't bring myself to tell anyone I actually know."
Why not.,"I'm at a dead end. All my dreams are dead. All my prospects are dead. I failed high school. I can't get a job. The love of my life left. And it seems no one cares. All thats left is my fucking skateboard. Why not just rob a bank or some shit. All the cash there is insured anyway so no ones really at a loss. Worst case I end up dead, best case I make some cash to fund my life for another few weeks. Win win as I see it."
Tried to kill myself yesterday,"At 3:30ish or 4AM, I swallowed 20 pills of NightTime or Medizen.

But the problem still remains: I'm here lol. Sleept about 14 hours and I dizzy as fuck right now.

Maybe that stuff wasn't strong to put me down for good. But will look into other stronger things.

Cheers lads!"
I don't want to talk,"But this feeling is suffocating me. I really need to do my homework, but I can't focus, on anything at all.

The cause of this is very mundane, yet to me is a monumental source of insecurity. Ì need help."
"Anyone else here want to live logically, but have random compulsive fears that your ABOUT to commit suicide.","Im going through this thing were my brain is in almost a physical pain about the fear that any second im going to walk somewhere remote and end it. Then all the pain will be gone once and for all. 

Im a pussy I hate pain a lot."
Life sucks,"Moved around for entire childhood, got a job at 14. Made first close friend at the job (a bit older than me) Skipped two grades of school. Best friend banged my mom, and convinced her to kick my father out of the house. Best friend became my mom's boyfriend and caused some of the worst experiences in my life, and now I struggle with extremely dark and violent thoughts after the memories. Mom's new boyfriend waves his gun at my young sisters threatening to kill himself, then goes upstairs and does it. Sisters (the most important thing in my life) now traumatized because I wasn't there for them. Now I'm a 15 year old senior who is socially behind 2 years by skipping, I can't make friends after what my best friend did, and I can't bring myself to enjoy anything anymore. My parents can't help anymore because they are worst wrecks than me and I barely sleep now. Life sucks. I don't foresee it getting any better."
My friends rejected me because of depression,"I was lonely my whole life. I just never could find people who would just care about me. I was manipulated by many of them to do their work or doing them a favor. 

In high shool i have finally met the right people  that I truly loved. I was depressed since primary school, so when I met them I wasnt feeling very well but I found myself truly happy around them. They were very supportive and seemed to really care about my feelings. Even made me to go to see a psychologist. 

When my mental health started getting worse and worse i think they started to be afraid of me. Almost immediately i was diagnosed with depression and put in queue to mental hospital. Soon after that I atempted suicide for the first Time. When they discovered Deep cuts on my throat, they called an ambulance and I was put in the mental institution. 

They never visited me, never called or tried to have contact with me if i didn't make the first step. Instead they were partying and talking shit about my family and me on a group chat. Just because I missed them.

When I got out and came back to school they were ignoring me. I tried to make any contact with them. They were accusing me of EVERYTHING. I was apologising to them, tried to resolve everything do they accused me of stalking and mother of one of them started to threating me and talking shit about me in the school. My friends told even the teacher that I was abusing them for a long time and I was even beating them. I don't understand why they were making up all this lies. All of this led to my second suicidal attempt and caused mental breakdown. 

After all of this they told me that I'm toxic and they need information from my psychiatrist about my mental state if I still want to have contact with them. They never had the courage to admit that they made all of these accusations. They didn't wanted to Tell me about it, everything i had to found out from my teacher that actually liked me and protected me from having problems because of it.

I have no idea what happend. It happend a year ago and I'm still covering all of this with my therapist. This  situation basically ruined me and now I cant leave my house because im genuinely scared of people. Most of The Time I'm not capable to leave my room and spent Time with my family.

At that time I had a psychosis and a couple of psychoatrist thought that I might had even a schizophernia, but later that idea was rejected. But I think it might be connected with this situation because the symptoms dissapered when it was over.

I still have no idea what went wrong. The saddest part is the fact that I was taking more care of my friends them of myself. They knew that they meant a world for me.

Thanks for listening I really needed to get it off my chest."
It’s back,"Planning different suicide plans in my head after every few minutes.


My mind is convincing me to give up and just die already.

I want to give up but I can’t.

I really want to die but after my last attempt I just can’t do it again.

I wouldn’t have the energy to pretend to be okay if I survive another attempt or an almost attempt.

I know people don’t hate me as much as my mind is convincing me.

I know some people probably care about me and I shouldn’t do this to them.

But hey I am selfish, I just want this pain to be over.

So guess who is cutting instead of making suicide plans? 

My dumbass, I just wish I die asap cause I am just wasting money and other resources by unnecessary being alive when I can just die and be away from this pain."
I don't think I can do this anymore,"I have been struggling for so many years now. It's so hard to picture any kind of future when you've always just assumed that you would kill yourself at some point. Everything breath I've taken, has just been one more second of prolonging the inevitable. 

&#x200B;

I walked away from everyone today. I couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't live with the misunderstandings, and being talked down to for doing the very things that they did to me. I think the worst part was, I'm in love with one of the people I left today. He knew, and he reciprocated. But despite all of the best efforts in the world, he couldn't, or maybe wouldn't, distance himself from what other people would say. 

&#x200B;

I left all of my DnD games. I left all of my discord servers, and deleted all of my friends. I emptied my steam friends list, and deleted everyone on snapchat. I look at those things, and I think now, why didn't I delete the apps? Why did I delete all of the people. Not just the people that were hurting me in the moment, but everyone. Because I knew it was going to hurt me. It was going to hurt me in the way I deserve to be hurt. I'd hoped it would push me over the edge. I have no way to contact anyone now. I don't know their discord numbers. They're just gone. 

&#x200B;

Though I'm sure they're happier that way. I tried to ask for help. I sat in my moms kitchen and I tried to tell her how I was feeling. What I had done. I said I needed help. She didn't help. She told me to get tinder and go out and meet new people. 

&#x200B;

Now I'm sitting here alone, with not a single person around. No one to talk to, and nothing to distract me. I don't know what else to do. I don't want tonight to be the night, but I'm terrified it's going to be. I want to figure out how to be okay. How to move forward from this crushing feeling that the only plan I need, is that I will kill myself eventually. But I don't know how."
"Rock bottom at 16, I don’t want ‘help’ again.","This time last year, I was a dude who’d just turned 15 and I was so suicidal that I dropped out of school, got immediate help. I’ve got trauma from when I was a little kid, I’ve been treated like shit my entire life. The therapy I had for a few months didn’t help in any way, I feel like I can’t be fixed. So 6 months go by and I enroll into a new school, around that time I stopped going to therapy but kept seeing a psychiatrist. Getting diagnosed with ADHD a couple of months ago helped and for 6 weeks up until a couple of weeks ago I was on Ritalin, now I’m on Vyvanse. It’s helped my grades, made me more social slightly less anxious but that’s it. I’ve lived here for about 2.5 years, I was born here and my mum’s from here but I didn’t grow up here and in no way do I fit in. This has resulted in being bullied a little, but the main trouble is with friendships and socialising. I’ve got a bunch of ‘friends’ who are fake as fuck, I’m treated like a joke down here. I’m in an even worse place (in my life) than I was a year ago, I don’t want emergency treatment again because I know it’s not for me. Being in the UK, I’d much rather the NHS help some kid who would benefit and enough resources have been on me. I’ve had CBT, psychotherapy and another type. Nothing will truly heal me. My psychiatrist talked about SSRI’s, I don’t know if I want to be dependent on another pill. And even if I do, it’ll take at least 4 months for an appointment and probably just under a year for the actual prescription, let alone settling on a medication (trial and error), I know this because it was the exact same with my ADHD medication. I do not know what to do, as much as I’m super suicidal and depressed, I don’t wanna tell someone and go back to CAMHS (name of U.K. mental health clinics), I can’t do it. Been smoking a lot of pot lately, just to escape. I haven’t noticed any memory issues and my short term memory’s always great (even after having used for months), but I’m scared it’s doing some sort of damage. I don’t smoke cigs because of what I’ve seen them do to those within my family, nor do I drink. That helps keep me alive, I’ve never fallen into the trap of smoking cigs and I’m proud of myself for it. I eat very healthy, I’m physically active and I try to meditate every once in a while. I’ve had a blood test and I’m physically OK. I keep getting flashbacks and I’m heartbroken over so many things. 
I don’t know where I’m heading, I could stay in high school for another few months and then go to college, or stay in high school for another year and a half and then go to uni. But more hell might fully break me, I don’t think I can take much more. I live in a dark, lonely, cold and drug filled town and that probably plays a huge role. I’ve hit rock bottom at 16, nobody can truly help me. The ironic thing is, I’m only staying alive for the people who are mainly responsible for doing this to me. Yes, I’m no longer a kid and am about to be a grown ass man. I should grow up, and chill out. But how can I? I’m wasting my best years of my life and everything’s going to shit."
I don’t know what to do,"I have anxiety and depression , maybe 1 or 2 friends, I have no social life, school sucks ass, and anywhere I go I’m all by myself. I don’t know how to talk to people, and the world is ending, yet I’m still alive. 

Death, for as long as I can remember has been my worst fear, but I am now considering it. I don’t want it to be slow or painful, but for it to happen in a blink of an eye, 

I am 15 years old and a freshman in high school. I get that people who were my age “went through the same thing.” But I dont think you were at all suicidal. I’m not trying to be mean, just wanting to get this off my chest. 

Each day I come home I might or might not play with friends which gives me a temporary solution to my emptiness, but I still feel absolutely lonely. Ill sit on my bed, eat every godamn I thing in the fridge and play video games untill my eyes cant take anymore. 

I’m very self conscious about my weight and always wear a hoodie everywhere. I bathe once every 2 or 3 weeks. And i always sleep in class.
I don’t give a shit.

There’s no future for me. No matter if I graduate with a full paid scholarship to Harvard. Because I nor anyone else probably won’t be alive by then. I am always unmotivated in everything I do. I’m always thinking about how ill die and when I’ll die. I’m always insulting myself about my social skills, my gaming skills, and pretty much every thing I do. I always ramble and think of myself as a moody, attention seeking brat. 

My teachers say I’m smart and I have a bright future ahead (which they tell every fucking kid that) In truth, I’m lazy, a liar, and a failure. 

I’m not going to kill my self at the moment, but it’s all a matter of if I want to die before or when the world finally burns.

Thank you for your time"
I genuinely can't feel happy,Their was a girl I like. And she like met u think. After a while we start talking a lot and snapping a lit. After a while I told her that when i was younger around 2 or 3 i was abused and stuff like that. (Now I am soon 16) and when I told her that adn than she ghosted me. And every day she dident ask me like was every ting ok or somting like that when I told her that I have problems and I have anxiety and Depression. And she told me that I can talk with her but I never felt genuinely like she tried to help me. Every tinge I said that something wrong with me she just said that their nothing wrong with me. And now she doesn't even open my messenges and ask if everything thing is ok. It is always me  I have to do the first step. The same with people around they say is everything ok I respond with no. And then they like you want to talk I say yes but after a while they just say hope everything works out for you. And it feels like their is genuinely no people who want to help me. And yesterday day I was thinking abot ending it all. But I got scared. And  dident to it. These day I feel like i have no point at liven. It feel like I am a person who nobody likes. And I never had a girlfriend or no one besides me  and I genuinely feel hopeless. Every day I want to take suicide. And people se something wrong with me but they dont ask me. If anything I going to end it all when I get a car or a gun. Because life has no meaning for us who have mental issues.
A pact I made with myself.,"So I'm not depressed, or I atleast don't think I am but I've been having thoughts of killing myself a lot recently. I've had these thoughts for years. 

I tried killing myself when I was 11 and vowed to myself I would never try that again. But 4-5 years ago I made a pact a with myself that if my mum were to ever die I would kill myself. The scary thing is that I'm 100% serious about this. This pact is very important to me and I consider it one of few things I'm serious/care about which says volumes about me. 

Anyway I've never really written about myself like this on the internet before so if it comes across as weird or all over the place I'm sorry. 

I suppose I just need some guidance on this because I've been thinking about it a lot recently."
there's no point if ur unhappy and alone,"we're all gonna die. everyone on this planet will die. what's the point of keep going and staying alive if ur unhappy and alone all the time? i just dont get it, i don't see the point. why would i choose to suffer for the next 20-30yrs before nature takes it's course? suicide is logical decision"
I don’t even know anymore,"I have never been a person. I’ve had depression since I was four, suicidal since I was eleven. I’ve never really made any connections with people. I was a nobody growing up. I remember the other kids didn’t want to be around me. I just felt different from them. I remember the last time I tried to make friends one of them told me,” No one likes or cares about you”. It remained that way through the years. During my middle school years, I was getting bullied. Everyone watched but didn’t say anything. Through all of this my home life wasn’t good. My family was drug addicts who’d abuse me. Eventually by the time I started middle school my parents were arrested for drug related charges and I went to live with my grandparents. It wasn’t a good place either. They abused me as well. I remember one day I came home from school and I was getting yelled at for not being good enough and that I should kill myself. I graduated high school and three months later I was thrown out. I was homeless for six months until the kindness of random people got me a job and a apartment. I have been “stable” for the past two years. I can’t do this anymore. I don’t have anyone. I rather be dead. I attempted last year but I lived. I just hate myself too much. I hate every aspect of me. I cry myself to sleep every night constantly reminded of how worthless I am. I can’t do this anymore. I’m sorry this is a jumble that means fucking nothing in the end. There’s a lot of other trauma I didn’t put in here, but it doesn’t matter anyways because I don’t matter."
Put my head in a belt,"Not sure what to think or what to do. I'm drinking. I feel rubbish. I can't get motivated to do things I used to enjoy, and I don't get happy or enjoyment out of things. I'm confused about what I am doing with myself and what direction I'm going. I put my head in a noose made out of a belt to see what it felt like. I just feel wrong and I just want to feel better again. I'm not sure what I'm expecting here. If other people have done similar and have managed to right the path that would be helpful. I just need some advice for people who have made it though."
I’m at a loss,"Never taken meds- miserable 
Start meds- miserable 
Stop meds- miserable 

Why can’t I get better?? I’m over this shit"
Boring.,Everything is boring. Nothing excites me anymore.
Male: 18. I´m tired and now I wanna sleep. I'm done with love and fake people leading me one. just wanted to tell someone. goodbye,
Why am I conscious?,"We'll have to start at the beginning to unpack this question;

Sex is very emotional, and also borderline painful. Good sex never includes being overly gentle and caring. It's rough, animalistic, painful, and emotional. 

We are born from this tension. 

Biologically, it's a rat race to the egg, where the cell in first place often times doesn't win. It creates an opening for a more opportunistic cell who takes advantage and ""wins"" the rat race. Then, at the time of birth, we all gather around and it's a mostly happy occasion, but the birth itself is traumatic and extremely painful. Has there ever been a baby born on this Earth that didn't wail and cry when they were born?

We are born from this pain.

A few years pass and your cortex develops into consciousness. We didn't ask to be conscious, it sort of just happened. It's painful to be conscious, especially when you are responsible for an entire universe that is your body. Sometimes it feels good to be alive, but mostly it's just pain. If God were a programmer, I can kind of see how this process might be a sort of motivation for innovation, but between our ego, conscious, and body, the entire thing just seems like a chaotic mess. I'll give the creator credit though, somehow life finds a way. 

We are driven to avoid this pain. 

Just when you get a grasp of your own body/universe, now you have to start interacting with other universes. Some of us grew up with supporting galaxies and stars, while some of us know nothing but black holes and death. What do you think happens when these different universes interact? Is it possible for one universe to impact other universes? Is that positive, or negative? How would our interactions with one another be different if we weren't conscious? Does pain make you conscious? Does sex make you conscious? Are movies, TV, food, video games, computers, entertainment, etc all just methods in which our brain tries to mitigate pain and increase other chemical reactions in the brain?

What is the meaning of this pain? Why am I conscious?

I've been asking myself these questions for the past 5 years. I went celibate and searched for answers for 3 months, and my interactions with women just confirm everything I listed above;

1. Life is suffering. Since that's true, people will seek out ways to limit this suffering, regardless of how they feel about you or what they say. 
2. Our society is sex crazed, so going celibate will make you stand out. You'll get the attention you're looking for, but you'll also learn the harsh truth about sex; it's painful, enticing, and motivates us to innovate or destroy. If life is suffering, then sex is guaranteed to create suffering. Why would anyone want to create more suffering?

So what's the point of it all? I know all of these questions are coming from my own ego, so what's the point of the ego if it's just going to complain about all of my unfulfilled desires all of the time? Am i suffereing because I am conscious? I feel like bees suffer, but they don't mull over their existence within the animal kingdom or worry about how much pollen will be available today. In order to be happy, do I need to shut off my ego or consciousness?

Despite all of these questions, ya wanna know the kicker? 

We'll never find answers to any of them :)"
Feeling Overwhelmed,"Usually, my suicidal thoughts don't last so long. But they don't seem to go away. Every day that passes is just a day of more of these thoughts. I know I have so many peoe in my life who love me and cherish me and would suffer fi I hurt myself in any way.

But I am so tired , you guys. I am so exhausted. I didn't think a twnety year old could be this exhausted. Life is exhausting. And i think to myself... What is this all worth? Why do i need to suffer in order to make others happy. I don't want to live. I just don't. I have no ambition anymore. I have no will to get anywhere. I don't want to do anything with my life. 

Sometimes, I wish i was a little more selfish. I wish I didn't care about anybody. Sometimes I wish I had less empathy. But as much as i hate being alive, my oarents will suffer if I kms. My brother will. My boyfriend. My best friend. My cousins. That is a lot of people who love me and look up to me and think the world of me.

I wish I didn't have them. I wish they'd all hate me. I wish I didn't have this thing blocking me I wish I could just die. 

I keep thinking lately on how to make it seem like an accident. How to kill myself but not having them know that it was suicide. Idk... I just wish this feeling would go away. I miss loving life."
"Please, is anyone free just to talk I’m going out of my mind and could really do with someone to speak with","I’m losing complete control, my life doesn’t feel like mine anymore. Dying has never seemed more appropriate."
Struggling.,"I’m beginning to think that my only option is suicide.
I had a depressive episode a few months ago but felt that I was somehow feeling more positive.
However more recently I’ve been struggling more often with suicidal thoughts, extremely low mood, low energy and justified negative thoughts about myself which seem far worse this time. 

I’m just about holding myself together and maintaining my job; which Is new however I’ve found that I’ve moved from one toxic environment to another possibly worse one.

I struggle with anxiety on a daily basis and find it extremely difficult to connect with others, I feel that I don’t belong anywhere hence having little to no friends and I feel so alone. 
I have completely lost interest and any enjoyment in anything that I previously enjoyed which makes my life feel empty and pointless. 
When I’ve talked to family I feel that no one understands how I’m feeling and makes me feel a burden or selfish. 
I just find that I no longer feel that my life is worth living.

I have tried to get professional help but feel that I was brushed off with no real helpful advice. 

Im not looking for sympathy, I don’t deserve or want that. I’m just hoping someone might have some advice that might help me. 
I don’t really have any options left. 
Thanks you in advance."
"I'm scared not because people will be sad for me, but they'll be angry at me.","I want to- no. I *have* to do it already, but I'm scared that everyone, my friends, my family, my abusive parents will all just look at me and say: ""Seriously? He resorted to killing himself? What a fucking joke."""
"I need to come up with three reasons to live by tomorrow, help?",
I really cant be arsed anymore,"I really don’t think I can be arsed anymore, I’ve lost majority of my friends I’m the largest simp going. I don’t really see my life getting much better than this only thing keeping me going is the selfishness of killing yourself. I don’t think I can hold on too much more really don’t think I enjoy anything anymore."
Life is hard...,"I've been stressing out for a couple of months because I'm a 24 year old college student who recently just got a mortgage. I never asked for this. I'm barely making enough to go by, I only make $500 every 2 weeks. Mortgage is $1600 and this isnt including power, water and utilities along with the other bills I have. I cant even afford textbooks for school. All I want to do is end it all. I dont care if I'm taking the easy way out. I'm surrounded by so many people. But it's difficult for me to express my feelings. I wonder sometimes if ending it would solve all my problems. Life's hard."
"Heard the news about the coronavirus outbreak,currently living in Taiwan,having some thoughts going on in my mind","This might be concerning for some people,but honestly,i really feel nothing,even worst is,i kinda wanna get the virus so i can get quarantined asap,and die because of it

I've been struggling with depression n anxiety disorder for quite a long time,and I've been feeling suicidal for god knows how long,never have the guts to commit suicide,and now,after hearing about the virus outbreak,i feel like,now i have a chance to actually end my life without have to commiting suicide

And of course,obviously,i dont wanna just go out and spread more viruses to people,if there's a chance,im willing to volunteer to get the virus injected to my body and let them study virus more with my infected body,i dont really care of i died,i really just wanna end my life im the most useful kind of way,at least i died with a value and can help more people to find a cure for this disease

Im on my med,im getting really confused n sorry for my bad weird grammar cuz i really cant think straight right now"
I’m done. I can’t do it anymore.,I really tried. I gave it time. I put myself out there. It’s clear I have 0 value to anyone. Men use me. Discard me like trash beneath the feet. Friends don’t truly care. I’m more a burden than anything else. I will not live my life this way. Having others happiness and love rubbed in my face. It’s over.
Why can't I muster up the strength to get a knife from the basement instead of using a shity dall shaving razor to cut?,"I just cut myself up after probably over a month maybe even 2 months of not cutting and well it fucking hurt before it didn't hurt I'm guessing the blade isn't quite sharp ( use to use it to shave but quickly found it it was too dall and made me bleed every time) or since I don't have bad anxiety my mind felt the negatives. But I know there's nice sharp knifes in the basement but I can't muster up any strength to get one and try to use it (even though I don't know how to make sure I don't go too deep) fucking hell my leg is burning and I'm not even wearing anything ( I cut where my under wear and my ugly stretch marks will hide it ) fucking hell im going to have to push myself to use a knife next time sadly

 fucking hell im a pussy it's nothing big I just don't use any pressure when using a knife stop freaking out body. Sorry for the internal dialogue."
Being suicidal is worse type of wasting life than actual suicide,"I still look good, am 31, am suicidal for 15-16 years and I can't use any qualities I have just because I have no motivation. It's like insane... I'm lonely but I can't stand other people even if they like me, I want more money but again can't stand people which I need to earn some.. If I was lucky I'd found girl to spend life with who thinks the same.. But I don't really even believe in ""true"" love.. So I feel Id kill myself less if I killed myself years ago... I just don't care about anything anymore.. I liked sports cars, I bought one real nice and I'm to lazy to even go to garage and drive it.. I'm athletic but I don't feel like proving any of my strenghts to others.. Idk..  I'm insane"
I feel so broken,"My home life is terrible, and it's been terrible for so many years. Everyone is always yelling, and it's so stressful. I don't feel a good connection with any of my friends, even the one's I've known for years. Rent is too high where I am, so I can't move out. My girlfriend broke up with me the other day. I feel so damn lost without her. I feel like she was the only thing that was keeping me sane. I just want to die so badly. There's a large bridge about 30 minutes from my house, and people have jumped off of it before and died, and I keep feeling the urge to drive to it and jump whenever I'm on the freeway. I was driving home the other night from work going like 90 on the freeway and I wanted to swerve into the railing so badly. I can't focus anymore. All I can do is sit there and cry. My head is a mess. I'm trying to distract myself but my thoughts always drift back. I can't do this anymore."
Everything hurts and i want to die,Title
I don’t know what to do,"Ive wanted to kill myself off and on for a long time now but i can never find the courage to do so. I often feel alone, and lately my emotions have been more out of whack than they’ve ever been because i keep messing up and im not sure what to do. Im sitting in my car now wondering if i should crash, OD on these painkillers i have in my cup holder, talk to my girlfriend and ask for help, or buy a gun off of someone and just end it all. I don’t feel like i have anywhere to go anyone to talk to I’m hurting and i just don’t know what to do"
"It's all gone. All of it tumbling down. It all boils down to being my fault. I miss her, I miss them.","I can feel myself becoming more bitter and envious day by day, apathy just growing into this abrasive thing that isn't comforting to me anymore. This isn't a situation with knowledge as outcome, just pure and complete failure. I've been picking at straws for so long, longer than I'm willing to admit. All of these things I told myself shattered by one phone call. One single word and my entire life fell a part. 

I always knew my life was unstable and frail, but I never thought it would break because of me. It's all because of me. Not my family, not those who've hurt me, not the doctors, not my mental deterioration. Just me, all of it. Fucking all of it. and I'm tired of acting as though there is something, fucking anything, that could possibly justify the things I failed or never tried. I fucking hate myself with a great passion, when I say passion I mean passion. 

I can't fucking sleep without thinking ""what if"" or ""why did you do x, why didn't you do y? Why are you like this, do you ever think about x?"" Just shut the fuck up, fucking shut up and leave me alone. I fucking know, I always knew for fuck sake leave me alone. I'm sorry okay? What do you want from me? There is nothing more I can do, leave me alone I fucking hate you. I know I'm a fucking failure and mistake, I know I have no life and deserve to die. Fuck sake what do you people want from me? Why am I such a fucking screw up. These thoughts grow louder and my meds don't do anything. I can get better, I just don't want to be. I want to be dead and I refuse to have anything get in the way of that. I want to do something that'll make them proud. Holy shit I'm just touching the surface on how badly of a screw up I am lol. It's all against me at this point, my options are slowly but surely narrowing. My head feels like it's melting. I'm fucking loosing it, not going crazy or anything of the sorts, just loosing myself. My entire life is just me in a constant argument with myself and it hurts. 

I'm not looking for advice, like hell there's anything I haven't heard at this point, I'm just venting is all. It doesn't help, not even a little, but I just want to thank those of you who helped me find a way to die. I'm going for the exit bag option, I just need a helium tank. I'm to die a lot sooner than I thought, might as well beat death to it. It all hurts, it's always hurt. What more is there to say? I'm a failure. I'm sorry."
I feel blind,"This is a strange feeling I'm unable to describe but it's like an inability to absorb life. I believe there are always experiences to be had. You're 5 senses are always receiving input. Your mind or consciousness is your interpretation of these experiences. I feel so unable to interpret in the way I want to. I'm reaching for a depth of understanding that I'm not sure I will ever receive. I am immature. I focus on the bad. I don't know how to take in the good. I have a desire to. I just don't know where to start. I feel blocked. Also empty. No matter what I pour into myself the things I receive continue to leak out. I have no way to keep track of the outside or the inside. I may know basic labels or have these preordained responses. But my focus is like a drifting compass. Constantly spinning. I can't seem to point in the direction I'm meant to go. I want to get around this problem. I want to become something great. But everything is disjointed in some way. The picture of the world I've received just isn't quite right. I don't like my way of being. To become engaged would mean shedding this cage in a way. But then I can't seem to get out. I feel like I'm choking for air. There are so many simple steps I could choose to take. All seem fruitless. I suppose I am a procrastinator and that's what I've always been. I am  the kind of human that is greedy for experience but all the wrong kinds. I feel like I've buried myself under all these bad experiences and the person that I could've been will never make it out alive. I suffocated her. I wish so many things. I wish to love. I wish to play. I wish to work. I wish......just never long enough to tether my soul to something worth living for. There's something bursting inside of me and the lack of expression is slowly killing me. I do not always want to be an observer without ability to participate. I want to get my hands dirty. To dig deep. I know every moment is available to me but I feel like time will always get away from me. All I know is I feel blind. Like I can't comprehend. There's something I'm not getting. Especially when it comes to bumping into other people in this world. I don't quite know what went wrong there but I hope someday I can fix it.

please just tell me things are gonna be okay,i crave comfort and hugs and cuddles and assurance even if it’s fake someone write me something tell me how amazing i am even if you don’t know me i’m fucking desperate for love and affection i don’t know why i am like this
"I feel like life has passed me by, I’ve become a forgotten memory of days past","Titles artsy I know, but in all seriousness the last year has broken me down to the point where I don’t know who I am anymore. All of my best and closest friends, have moved onto new chapters of their lives and I’ve essentially lost contact with most of them outside of the occasional happy birthday message. The love of my life who I had been with the last 3 years slowly drifted away from me until one day on my way home from college classes she called to tell me we were through. A month later she was with someone new, and told me I didn’t work hard enough to keep her and that I had become “boring” to her. Not even a month after that I lost my job which was allowing me to live on my own. I’m now back to living with my parents, who’ve now told me they are getting a divorce, and that I’ll have till summer to find a new place to live. I feel like I’ve wasted the last 3-4 years of my life and that I have no reason to continue"
Had a huge mental breakdown two hours ago because of several things that happened throughout the day.,"My day started of quite bad. I got called by my best friend (male) at midnight. He sounded totally shitfaced. There were a lot of background noise and a lot of talking. He asked me if I was awake and alone at 00:15. Which I said ""yes?"" to. I had no idea what was going on. Then all of a sudden a girl started talking to him and hung up the phone. Cue panic attack. Like wtf was that all about. I texted him ""okay?"" about fifteen minutes later.

Around five I woke up because I felt like I was going to throw up and saw that I had two unread messages from him. In an almost unreadable text he said ""huh, have I called you? Oof"" (translated from another language).

I wasn't able to sleep for almost an hour because ya ""boi"" had another panic attack while in bed.

Then I woke up at around 14:45 I woke up because I had to pee. Dropped my phone on my way to the bathroom and found out that my bank card is gone. (Card is supposed to be in the little pocket on the case). Went upstairs to tell mom, while having a full on panic attack, only to find my aunt and grandmother in the living room. Guess who decided to invite family over for dinner without telling me (and mom).

I have been diagnosed with autism, so the change in my plans caused an even bigger panic attack. Yay me.

Three hours later (after dinner), a different ""friend"" sent me a long video of him lip syncing to ""make you mine"" by PUBLIC. I hate getting videos of him. It makes me sick to my stomach. You may think ""what's the problem here?"". He's in his thirties. I'm still a couple of years away from 20. I've told him so many times I don't want him as a boyfriend. (1 because of age difference. 2 We live in different countries. 3 I'm into girls.)

So anyway, after I had to painstakingly watch my way through that video, I sent him a snap saying ""I do not enjoy videos from you"". He read it wrong and thought I said that I do enjoy getting videos from him. Se sent the video in chat and saved it together with a cheesy paragraph basically saying ""since you loved the video so much I'll save it here so you can watch it whenever you're feeling down. I love you lots.""
After I corrected him, he got all sad and said ""well shit 💔"". I muted him again at that point.

A few hours passed and I thought that was it for the day, but oh boy were I wrong. I watched a r/wholesomememes video by The Click. I thought it'd make me happy, but it just made me cry more and more. That's what happens when you bottle up emotions for months. At the end of the video I was just full on ugly crying. I put on my favourite album by xxxtentacion, as you do when you see no end to your suffering. I ended up ugly crying for half an hour while listening to 17 on repeat.

After I cleaned up my tears and blew my nose, I just sat at my bed for a while. Tried to watch videos, but I just felt dead. No spark in my eyes, no smile, no laughter, no emotion. Just dead, but breathing.

Then I cut myself. Once, twice, more and more, the blood started dripping quicker and quicker. I stopped and got some paper towels because, ya know, don't want to leave any blood on the clean bedsheets.

So here I am. I failed the ""no self harm"" goal I made for 2020. Just spent an hour typing this. Even though probably nobody's going to bother reading it all. I want to die so bad."
backed into a corner,"I have been asked to abandon my cats and I'd rather abandon life. 

I spiralled a bit. Signed up for some weird websites. Because no one looks after your asshole cats like you would. 

But I'm cool with just dying before they do."
courage,how do i get the courage to commit? these past couple of weeks have been agonizing. i have no one here for me anymore and i’ve driven away everyone i care about with my “problems”. my boyfriend has just been telling me i’m too negative and i should be supporting him make healthier decisions and it feels so shitty to keep it all in. the only way out of this cycle for me is to commit but i’ve never had the courage to do so. how do i get out of my life
I just don't have the courage to live,"I'm extremely privelaged to not be in a situation where I'm completely starving and homeless, but I just don't have the courage to ""do"" life. To fill my time actually being productive and living life with actual goals and priorities in mind, to actually be thoughtfully invested in the direction of my life. 

Every week I say to myself that today is the last day I'm going to waste in my life. That after today, I will get up early and start doing all of thing things I know I should be doing. 

But I can't. I just can't bring myself to start living my life. I just can't. I don't want to. I need to but I can't. I don't want to give up smoking. I don't want to build relationships with people. I don't want to work out. 

I don't want to use my time to improve myself or my skillset. I just can't. I can't just start actually trying in life. I just don't have the courage to dedicate my time and mental energy to anything that would be remotely productive. I just hate being productive. I just want to be able to laze about all day and all night. If I could find some kind of 9-5 gig that allowed me to live comfortably I would, but being out completely on my own to choose do something... anything. And I'm too much of a coward anyways. I feel like, as a man, a lot of the blue collar options available to me involved to much risk of bodily harm. I'm just a coward man. I'm so afraid of physically suffering and experiencing agony that I honestly just want enough courage to be able to get it over with instead of having to live just waiting for my final moments to come swiftly and suddenly. I don't get how anyone lives. I can't distract myself from my own death. 

I don't want to die, and I don't want to waste my life being ""disciplined"" if it's all just going to completely end anyways."
It's time,"I think it's just time 
Literally everything has fallen apart. And not in the way where one or two things have gone wrong and it might take a while to get back on your feet. Literally everything..
I'm in a new country that I thought I'd be spending time here indefinitely with the person I was meant to be with forever and my cat.
Getting here was all on my funds. My credit cards.
Getting set up was the same. Everything on my cards.
But now we've broken up. I have no social circle 
I can't bear the thought of going through a divorce or moving back home 
Everything will cost anyways. No matter what I'll be at a loss 
And, if I'm being honest, it's mostly monetarily. Which shouldn't be such a big deal but it is 
I've always been good with money. I very very rarely spend money on myself 
The past three years has all been about spending money on him and what makes him happy. And of course my cat but that's a no brainer.
But if I leave now. I have nothing. Nothing to show for the past three years except for a broken heart. And I still wouldn't have spent any money on myself. So I can't even leave and give myself a new start. Buy myself some new clothes or anything.
It just all feels so meaningless.

And before anyone gets on me for only focusing in money; please don't 
It's just something im immediately focusing on rn because of the breakup 
I'm still cripplingly depressed (bipolar) so that's already hard enough. It's just that all this stacked on that is breaking me. Further. I'm already broken. I shouldn't have married. Shouldn't have moved. Now everything is ruined and there's no turning back.

There's nothing else to do 
There's nothing else left for me. I have no degree. Nothing worth contributing towards society. I'm just a husk of a person going through the day to day. 
My parents and friends would be sad but overall, life would continue. And it wouldn't really matter. So why am I continuing to suffer to stop others from being sad for just a little bit? Idk .. I guess that's why it's time ."
Just getting this out there.,"Yeah I know, you've seen and read 1000s of other posts like this before, there will be 1000s more afterwards. But for real people, I'm tired. For the last 15 years I've been depressed. It all started with me being bullied in school and not having friends. The teachers put me in this area during break time called ""The Friendship Area."" Basically they'd go around hunting down kids who were all alone and put them there in hopes they'd make friends, sigh, not me though. As a matter of fact I was there for 3 years (grade 4-7) just chilling, reading comics and drawing etc while other kids came and left. Then came high school. Met my first real friend and life started seeming okay. We were friends for 3 years, we'd hang out every weekend, play games together and all that. Then on Oct 26 2013 I got a phone call from his brother to let me know he hung himself. I won't bother typing out how it made me feel, I'm sure you can figure it out. So anyways, back to being a lonely sad fucker. Then 2 months later, in the same month, both my grandparents who basically helped raise me passed away. So a few months later we got kicked outta our house cos we didn't pay rent on time for a few months, idk my mom kept that shit private. So we ended up in a motel room. How'd we pay for it? Well simple, my mom let men satisfy themselves with her for money. I'd sit on the bench outside of the motel, headphones on, watching men (black, white, colored...) enter the room and leave. It really made me feel like dying right then and there. So after a few weeks of this shit my uncle came and picked me up to stay by him. I dropped outta school. It was all fine until he started going psycho and rampaging through the house over drugs and alcohol. So I ran away from him and got a job, a decent job, for the next 3 years. Idk if its the depression or anxiety or sheer lack of motivation that lead to me quitting, but I did. Now I'm sitting here typing this, unemployed for the last 9 months, addicted to painkillers and with no will to live. Just ready to die. Just felt like getting that out there. Never been good with explaining stuff so forgive me. I'm 23 btw."

So anyway I’ve been suffering from quite bad anxiety and more recently depression for about 1.5 - 2years (may not be as long as others but it hit me hard) anyway I’ll go back to where it started in P7 (year 7 in America) anyway this is really when it all started see in Easter at that time my parents split up and I was heart broken since back then I thought my parents loved each other and never caught onto the concept that this could happen to my family. Anyway 6 months before the split my dad had to quit his job because he got arthritis in his back. So since my dad couldn’t get payed he had to move to my grandma and Grandad’s and is still there to this day. So what happens is me and my brother (non identical twin) go to my nana and grandads for the weekend/night and we have to all sleep in the spare bedroom but I’m fine with that for a while but tbh it all got bad in my first year of high school or S1.

Se I wouldn’t say I was unpopular but I was popular in the way that I was just nice to everyone in primary school I just generally didn’t want to hate anyone. I was also a bit of a teachers pet in the sense that I wouldn’t snitch just always would quietly do the work since I was quite introverted but tried as well to be more extroverted. So now I’m in S1 surrounded by old and new faces. It goes fine until after a few weeks  my class all of a sudden starts misbehaving. Now since I’m typing this I’ll find it hard to fully explain but I mean in the way that we wouldn’t get much work done and me (and the few other introverts) would be punished with the class as well u know the whole “the whole class had to learn” bs. So I developed an anxiety quite a bit based on going to school and noise.  So I start struggling to get into school but don’t worry as I told my mum the things I was feeling. So I end up having a day off, then again, then again, and again, and again and so on. It gets to the point when my guidance teacher notices this and tries to help me get in more. One thing was letting me leave school at lunch and going to a counciler (which did not help at all but the counciler was very nice). So what happens is my teacher tries to get me in on 6th block some days and we slowly work up the ladder to get me in to school. 

Just to note as well I really do care about my education because I know if I want a good life I have to work hard so me not going to school made me upset since I was glad I didn’t have to go in but also I knew u was badly effecting my education.

So this goes on until it gets to the point when Im mostly in at school and doing full days but still feeling the same. It gets to a point however when I get it go to this place called the den, a quiet place for students to do work at (my dreamland). 
Now in S2 however things get even worse. First of all remember when I talked about going to my nana  and Grandad’s each weekend well I stopped going there because it made me upset that I had to constantly move around and not get to be at my own house a lot at the weekends. My dad fully understands and months later the same thing is still happening. Everything I mentioned keeps happening since a while later when I start getting self conscious about my self.

1. I had acne quite early and it got bad fairly quickly.
2. Apparently I had a head shaped like an alien
3. I got this thing nicknamed pigeon chested syndrome which basically meant the bones in my rib cage almost stuck out giving me an almost lump on my chest. This effected me the most since I couldn’t do a lot of activities such as swimming or PE without getting worried people would see it.
4. I got quite deep stretch marks from a growth spert I had so yeah not good.

This all brought me down and up to probobaly November or early I realised it. I also had depression and soon after suicidal thoughts. These scare me and still do to this day as I don’t want to think them but I do and I hate it. Don’t worry I’ve told my mum but not yet my dad.
Why? Because after seeing how much my mum worried about me I didn’t want to tell anyone else about it as I didn’t want them to be worried or brought down like my mum did.

That comes to the end of it, I’m sorry if it was messy as I was just spewing out all my thoughts and tbh there’s probably more to talk about but I just can’t fully remember or dont want to say.

I don’t care if no one reads this I just kinda needed to vent might even delete this I don’t know.

Edit: just to say I finish writing at 23:30 and I should be sleeping for school but waking up to school and also being in bed is when the thoughts fly I guess since I’m not concentrating on anything like my Xbox switch phone etc.
I’ve also noticed that I set my alarm at 7 and I use to be great at getting out of bed but now I find myself being told by my mum to get up since I just lie in bed not wanting to get up and go through hell.

Edit again: I just also want to say yes this is probably like all the other posts and as another said you’ll see a 1000 more like this. Just also as well as I mentioned the suicidal thought scare me as I’m not brave enough to stab myself or run in front of a care or just jump. The same with cutting myself I have the thoughts every day even just passing by the kitchen knifes in my house I have to walk away so I don’t do it."
So I'm pretty sure my best friend is going to commit suicide and I don't know what to do.,"I read some of their reddit posts, they are going to do it soon. I don't know what to do to convince them not to and also i don't want to tell them that I found their reddit account. If they know that i know their account they won't post anymore and I want to keep track of them. How to I talk to them about it? They are one of my only friends, and my best friends. They are the only I'm still alive I can't loose them, I don't know how to help him."
i'm so sad,"fuck I'm so tired.

I'm honestly always so overwhelmed and so fucking sad. 

I know i'm loved and I have people who care about me. I have a roof over my head and come from a middle class family who can afford to send me to college with no debt. my life is so good. my family loves me and even when we fight, i know they mean well. my boyfriend is the kindest, sweetest boy who not only loves me so much and reassures me about my selfworth. he is a perfect example of what it  means to compassionate and kind to others while also know when to set healthy boundaries for his own mental health . i love him so so much and he makes me feel so happy 

so why the hell am i also so fucking sad. it's so unfair to them because i just feel sometimes like nothing is worth living for.  like my life is really so good. like i truly am only holding on to life  because how sad my friends and family would be without me. 

it's just i hate myself so fucking much. why is it that when I really try to sit down and think about what i actually like about me it's so hard to come up with anything.  I feel like such a disappointment even though i know my family and friends only want me to be happy. i feel so empty sometimes and i just wish i could disappear without a trace. like leave and no one remembers me so that no one is hurt that i'm gone. but the closest thing to that i can get to is dying. and right now, i can't do that to them. 

but God, sometimes living is straight up agony. I just want the pain to stop holy fuck i want to die so bad i want it to just end. i want to stop feeling this endless self-hate holy fucking shit"
I'm a failure to my family,Everytime I'm with my dad it always turns to me crying and tell him to fuck off and ether cutting or attempting I'm just done with everything I wanna just ina  nice dark place and never come back  I cant keep living its gonna turn badly I just know it
Why am i alive,"What's the point. First of all, im a NEET. No job, no education, living with my mommy. I'm 24....yes you read that right. 

I'm also plagued with a bunch of painful physical conditions, all of them permanent. My libido is completely gone so i wouldn't be capable of any relationships (not that i would be desirable to any woman to begin with), and to top it all off i'm also depressed. Maybe. I haven't been officially diagnosed. All i know is there's no point to my existence. If i wasn't afraid of death i'd have killed myself already, so i guess there's that. 

Not even sure why i'm posting here. I do hope there's life after death. Because this life has clearly not worked out. 

I hope i muster up the guts to end it all one day, but until then, i'm stuck in this meaningless loser life.

I'm sorry mom, dad, i wish i amounted to more."
Heartbroken,I met a man in November who made me feel so special. I wanted him in ways I’ve never wanted someone before and you could definitely say I was falling for him. We bonded so much over two months and just a few days ago he died. I feel so empty inside and that I’ll never be okay again. I want to be in his arms again and I’ve been plotting my suicide. I’ve written a handful of goodbyes to my friends and I’m waiting to go back to the city before writing my families. I’ve been trying to convince myself it gets better but without him and the motivation he gave me I don’t think it will.
Everything is my fault,"You can’t control the things that happen to you but being a good person is totally up to you

The bad things that have happened to you can’t justify what you’ve done

I think that’s one of the main reasons why I’ll do it. I can’t fix this life, I hate this shitty life and things won’t ever get better. Why did I have to be born in this family and in this circumstances?. There’s people who put no effort in their lives and they still have better ones than me. I can’t do it and I’m tired of it.

I’m an asshole an I don’t know how I fucked my life so much. I fuck every single aspect of this life in any possible way. 

I want to scream 

(Sorry for my bad grammar)..."
I attempted last year.,"I attempted to kill myself this time last year. 
A relationship I was in broke down, and my “best friend” was busy with her new boyfriend so she didn’t talk to me much, and I just felt so alone. 

I’d contemplated killing myself before and was an active self harmer and have been for about three years now. 

The day it happened I had had an argument with my parents and it just added to already feeling like shit. I felt unwanted by my friends and now by my family. So I decided to stop being a burden to people and stop annoying them.
I took several boxes of ibuprofen, wrote some letters to explain what I’d done, and went to sleep.
I didn’t expect to wake up. I still have the letters I wrote to explain this to people. 
Needless to say I woke up the next day and had to go to school as normal. 

I felt so numb. It was horrible. I still feel numb most of the time now. But hey, when you’re this good at faking a smile, no one can tell. Perks of studying drama. 

I’m getting help now, I’ve had one therapy session so far, and I don’t know if I want to tell them about this. I’m a minor, and I don’t want them to have to tell my parents. They would be so pissed if they found out what I’d tried to do. 
I just don’t know what to do. 

I’m sorry for the long post, I just need some advice, and there isn’t anyone irl that I can ask without getting into trouble."
"Have no self-worth, seriously considering leaving.","I’m struggling on making a final decision because I know my family spent money and years to get me to where I am today, and I dont want all that to go to waste. Due to my age I feel like I could have a happy life but no friends, nothing to look forward to, and self hate makes everything a lot harder. It’s probably best I go for everyone anyway."
Life is Pointless,"Why is life so pointless. Nothing matters? Why should I keep working in my useless underpayed job, why should I get home from work to spent the rest of my day playing video games to cope with the fact I don't have friends. Why should I keep drinking to fill the void after my gf left me. There is no reason why I shouldn't end it right here, right now. I've lost everybody I care about. It's just a big ol void
I just can't continue like this
I just feel :( all the time

So many questions, and no answers"
They do don’t make decisions based on factors of today.,"For example, I have a million reasons to kill myself today but many of those reasons will disappear tomorrow and a million more next year. But my issues I know will persist into the future and in the future too, I will not have many reasons to live. What do you say to that? Where they’ve not only lost hope in the near future, but also in the far future? Where they cant go on from what happened yesterday in the last and can’t go on because the future will only worsen? 
“Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.” My last controls my future and my present controls the past. My present is failing. My last has failed. My future will fail. I want to die."
suicide attempts,i already attempted suicide twice this year. 2020 is not off to a great start.
Life kind of sucks for me,"I'm 19.Life went pretty well back then but, recently, I began feeling like shit, I don't know why, but my mood is down.
I always feel tired, even when I sleep 8 hours a day,I'm tired of everyone,I have no friends, I CAN'T make friends because I have severe social anxiety,I am angry all the time, I don't have any hobbies,I feel like I can't do anything and my life is a mess.
Whenever I think about my future I feel down,like I'm a failure and a disgrace for my parents.
I even considered ending it all.
Any advice?"
I need a hug.,
i fucking hate being transgender,"can't take this shit anymore. i'm 20, i live with my super-conservative parents and can't get a stable job because i'm autistic so there's nothing i can do but fucking suffer. please convince me to kill myself, please, i don't want to do this anymore."
Anybody?,I'm so suicidal right now please I need to cry on physically I can't control myself please
Need help,"Recently got out of a 4 year relationship and my ex has already moved on with one of my old friends. I was molested as a child by my uncle and he now works at the same place as me and is on my shift and I see him everyday now and it just kills me that he acts like nothing happened and acts like we're still cool or something. I am broken as of right now and think suicide is the only thing that will help. Been awake for 24+ hours because my heart can't stop racing because I can't stop thinking about it. Just really don't wanna feel like this anymore.

Edit: I have tried to hotlines and it honestly just pissed me off, hanging out with friends just doesn't feel the same right now either. Hoping  someone on Reddit has some good advice for me.

Edit2: I think it's just time to hang it up, no pun intended. More stuff just keeps happening throughout this shitty day and I just keep getting pushed lower and lower."
"Anyone else feel like they’re seeing parts of their life they shouldn’t be? Like you were supposed to die, but you didn’t, and now everything feels fake?",That’s a feeling I’ve had for the past month now. It just feels like I should have died before all of this happened.
I don't think I can continue,"(20m) I have been suffering from severe depression my hole life I used to have a bunch of friends to be around so it helped keep my mind off of it but here recently they have stopped talking to me and now the only friend that stayed by me side is now starting to ignore me because is new girlfriend hates me for whatever reason, I'm supposed to be celebrating my 21st birthday with him this weekend but every time I try and talk to him about it he doesn't answer I'm afraid he will bale on me again and if he does that I really know he doesn't want to be around me anymore so I'm afraid that will be the last thing that drives me to take my own life because this hole time I haven't was because he was there for me because no one else is and I just really dont want to lose him, I  cant take it anymore so this might be my last week of life

..... but I guess if he doesn't I will have to tell him completely how I feel and what I'm scared that will happen I just don't want to be the reason he breaks up with her

Fml"
please talk to me,
I’m stabbing myself with scissors in the chest at school tomorrow,I’m going to try to get the sharp part in my heart. I’m about to write my suicide note.
Never before did I have such a temptation to just slice my wrist and be over with it,"Made a secondary account because I don’t want people I know on here to be worried. I know that’d I’d never get myself far enough to actually do it, but the urge can be so overwhelming at times it scares me. Just need to vent I guess. 

I don’t know what I should do anymore. I’m stuck here at home where I live with the biggest sources of negativity and sadness in my life, yet I cannot leave because I’m still too dependent.

It will be 3 years till I have a degree and can leave this place for good, I just hope I’ll live to see that happen. I’m done, my flame is slowly dying out and I can’t bring up the energy to keep fighting for it.

Didn’t check the rules of the sub, just searched for a sub concerning suicide and went for it.
If this is against the rules, mods please do delete this and I’m sorry for the inconvenience. I needed this out of my head."
I feel so useless to those I love and live with,"Because of me they are going through stress in a move to better their lives. My roommate is family to me and to her almost since day 1 of meeting we have called each other brother and sister.
Now she already has a new job in Florida( we are currently in NC) but can't find a place to live that can fit all of us and she won't be making money until see he moves to the new job.
I just feel like all the problem and stress are because of me and I can't deal with it anymore but I'm so ready to tell her to forget we ever met And just end it because without her I have nothing and without her I would be living on the street anyway. So why live to hold her back which is killing me emotionally and mentally and just end it all and end up in a pauper grave as I have no one else.
Train tracks run past our current complex and I can already picture my self waiting for the next one to pass with an unscheduled stop soon after."
I really don't know what's going on around me and I don't want to come off as an attention whore,"I don't want to come off as an attention whore but I also secretly want help but therapy and counseling is such a taboo subject where I live. I can't find help in my family because my older sister (the only family member I am aware of going to therapy) will probably try to boost it up to the higher ups(my dad got angry at her when he found out she seeks therapy and even told her that it's going to ruin her career.)


Here is the main reason I am scared of approaching for help and why I think my any issue I have is insignificant and my existence to my loved ones is even more.

It alll started when I had a mini breakdown in the car where I couldn't figure out what I felt but also asked for help to go to a therapist which he replied with you don't need help you haven't being through real stuff, also he talked about how a patient is turned in and self awareness is a sign that I dont need any help but what made everything worse. what still sticks with me is the fact he had it within him to start screaming at a  crying and  clearly stressed teen for around 15 minutes when even my mom was hinting at levels of discomfort from side which were clearly visible( teary eyes and a sniffing nose) but he chose to ignore that"
Truth helps,"Instead of trying to mask my gut intuitions about what motivates my behavior, I allow myself now to manifest what I think is true beneath every show I tended to display instead. ""To thyself always be true."" Most things I do in the life are too appease others' expectations, but not to serve my own desires. Well, recognizing this makes me content to survive and do nothing where nothing is truly required for the end of surviving. Thus, fk all your expectations and demands on me. Do them yourself."
im a porn addict asshole....has a fucking fetish towards males maoning and gays ....even tho im a female ....what is wrong with me,"fuck this shit show im so done...
like i said...18 june or around that month im
fucking 
LEAVING

EDIT: thanks so much guys for the nice
and accepting comments...i wish my family were like you...they hate me and think im a weirdo....they always make fun of my looks and my behaivours....the problem is not in me liking gay porn the problem is all around me tell me that all the gays go to hell and if i enjoy watching them im forsaken by god...which is making me feel unwanted and abandoned....


i fucking hate this shit...makes me really suicidal...no one is interested in my things i enjoy....no body to share my hobbies....no one is for me in general
im so alone...i hate this"
I was Sexually Assaulted and no one belived me.,"I didn't really know where to post this but I've been struggling with depression even before I was assaulted because of my father's drinking problem and all the issues that brought to my family. We had to move out of our home because he didn't work but would spend money like he was earning 150,000+ a year. This started when I was young but it was managable until last year when O was sexually assaulted (forced to penetrate, as it wasn't legally rape because I am a man) and then accused of rape by the person who raped me. As a man no one belived me so after I told a few people the full story and got backlash I just said I was falsley accused when they asked. When I told my dad I wanted to do something legally against the rapist (I told him several times but he didn't want to as he didn't believe me either) it came to a point that he told me he wouldn't care if I when to jail for life if it meant ""me shutting the fuck up"". My ""friends"" kept hanging out with the woman who was spreading lies after I repeatedly told them not to. They treated it as any other highschool drama, ""we don't want to pick sides"". I've been having legal battles ever since to prove my innocence but it doesn't have an end anywhere in sight. After a year and a half and now entering my second semester of university I decided to just leave all the group chats I had with my so called friends. It took me a while because I was scared of what would happen, being completely alone as I am now. I feel like shit and being alone with my thoughts makes it worse minute by minute. I've sought therapy but living in a conservative country like Mexico every therapist I've gone too has said the same thing. ""That can't happen to a man"" or something along those lines. I really don't know what to do as I go to a local university like most of my ""friends"" and the rumor has spread there too and I have had no luck making any kind of friend ship (even superficial) in my first semester of uni. Now I barley leave my room as I have no reason to leave. I've lost all passion for everything I used to like, studying, music, instruments, nothing bring me joy anymore not even the things I could rely on when I first started having depression. I'm scared that one day I'll just be to fed up and act on my impulses like I have before. I've tried to hang myself twice but the bar the belt I used one broke and my brother walked in on me once. I really don't know what to do I have no resources and no one I can rely on."
"Lost and don't know what to do, I can't find a point in life","I'm 19 yrs old, probably a gay, fat and ugly as hell, no point in life, school ends soon for me, final exams are coming, I'm totally lost. My life is just one big mess and honestly I feel like there is no space for me here and it'd be better if I died. Nobody really cares about me.

This is my first time sharing my complete life history and I'm ashamed but I feel like I need to talk with someone... It's hard for me to speak in public, something like social anxiety.

I used to live in village with my grandparents (from father side), my mom, my father and his brother. There was cold in winters cause the house were old and has old central heating furnace. My mother was the only one who truly cared about me back then, she would do everything to make me happy, but money was the barrier. Once she told me she sold her wedding ring just to buy me kid milk when I was really young...

My father is alcoholic, he drinks only where he can - where he has money. He was working sometimes but not for long, maybe one week or so and then he got drunk in job so he got fired and again. His brother is addicted to alcohol too, but he didn't work at all, he was only stealing money or something he could sell from his parents and got drunk for that. My parents were arguing so often. My grandparents were (and still are) giving them space to live in their house, buying food and all stuff, they even buy them cigarettes. That's why I hate them (grandparents).

Now I live with my grandma (from mother's side) and mother in 2 room flat, me and my mom share on room and that's not a problem for me, but it would be better to have my own, cause I'm 19 and need some privacy or something like that. I guess. I never had that before.

Money and stuff is not a problem now, my grandma is working abroad (2 months working then she comes back and again) while my mom is not.  I love her and she loves me but I feel like she likes that, living without feeling bad about being well kept by my grandma. Overall she's too old to work hard abroad (she works as carer for elderly people).

I never felt like I can trust my family. Never talked with them like normal teens and parents do.

I have only one true friend but she's so busy I don't want to bother her and second that don't care about me, he only writes when he wants something from me. I feel like I need someone with I could talk. I just need a friend...

I'm currently studying IT in high school, I used to think about going to college but I don't see any sense in that. Also I was thinking about going straight to work, find apartment and move out. But I don't have any experience in working, only school so nobody would hire me. I'm a total loser.

I think everything would be better if I was dead, sometimes I really feel like I'm about to kill myself. 

I don't think someone will read this post, all I have is hope that someone want to talk with me.

But if you've read that, thank you."
Stress is killing me and nothing is going my way,"I can't sleep properly at night. I'm a university student and my grades are going down the toilet. I'm going to take way more years to finish this degree than I should and I'm gonna ruin my family financially, not to mention disappoint them more than I have up until this point, and boy was it a lot. And don't tell me to talk to them about my condition, I tried before and they just don't get it. I started having panic attacks recently and their reaction was ""Eh, that's how it is nowadays, people are stressed"". I can't afford a therapist in this country and my university's mental health support is a bad joke. People in this university kill themselves regularly and all they do is wash their hands with this issue. Absolutely no help for us. They just want our money and that's it, they don't even treat us like humans, we're just numbers in their bank accounts.

I know everyone talks about how suicide can never be an option and it's ""a permanent solution to a temporary problem"" or whatever, but maybe, if we are to think rationally, without involving emotion (I know, easier said than done, but yeah), can't we acknowledge that maybe, just maybe, it could be for the better for some people? Even if I pull through, all these years of depression, anxiety, stress and a crippling cigarette addiction are sure to come back to bite me one day. I'm not set to live a long life anyway, I'll get a stroke or heart attack or whatever in max 20 years and I'd honestly rather die now, with dignity and integrity, rather than live my last days incapacitated on a hospital bed.

And I don't give a fuck about the afterlife, I fear no Gods. All I yearn for is the beautiful tranquility of death, that one moment when I close my eyes for the last time and my inner voice whispers to me ""It's over, all of your problems are no more"" (might not be anywhere close to how it feels like to die, but that's just the way I fantasize it and hey, it's beautiful).

I have friends, that's the one  thing I can't complain about in life. They are the most beautiful and lovely people you'll ever meet. The only drawback to my suicide is having them and my family(even though our relationship isn't exactly great, but I still love them and I know that so do they) suffer. I would hate that. But I feel like they would understand. They would understand that I just couldn't bear anymore and that this was indeed the best solution for me. None of them are exactly strangers to my condition, you know, and they do their best to help, and I appreciate that more than I could ever express in words, but, you know, there are some things that no one can figure out for you.

Tbh writing this whole thing gave me a little bit of relief, which was much needed, seeing as how I was on the verge of another one of my lovely panic attacks not more than 30 minutes ago. But I know this won't last, sadly.

Shit, such a horrible world we're living in."
I can’t do it anymore,"I’m so done, I almost killed myself today in the middle of a forest and the only reason why I didn’t do it was because someone was followin’ me.

I’m so tired of gettin’ a little bit of hope and then gettin’ it torn away from me.
I’m tired of skippin’ school because all of the students suck on it.
I’m so tired of just layin’ in bed all day, depressed and alone and no one to talk to. I can’t even tell my friend about it since they’ll just get triggered. All they did was give me a suicide hotline and I honestly feel like they wouldn’t care if I died, they wouldn’t even know, since we only talk on the internet.
I’m so tired.
I don’t know what to do anymore, I’ll most likely start collectin’ my sleepin’ pills until I’ve got enough to end it all.
Then I can finally get away from this borin’ place."
I fucked up big time,"This year I slacked of my studies and lived the laziest life a human can imagine I mean I have some over due classwork, two out of seven failed subjects and the rest of the grades are absolutely shit. 

Click on the speed up button and now it's after term 2 examinations and I failed 3 tests and the grades are as the following 24% in Arabic first language (Our teacher helped pick the hardest past paper in recent history and he even admited to that.), 35% in accounting(So if it was during an actual igsce I would've probably passed) and a 40% in bio.The passed subjects had a grade the following 80% english as a second language, 65% math core, 51% business and a 53% in Ict so even the passed subjects don't help.


Minutes ago my father started to get angry(His pupils widened, tone and speed change plus he started to do the good ol fashion attempted investigation) and asked about my grades and me being me(the complete dumbass who can't handle any pressure he throws) started to stutter around and gave him facts that sounded like straight up lies(they were facts but I stuttered and stumbled). He has a meeting on Wednesday and already told me to pack up most of the ""fancy tech""(I put it in apostrophes because it's just a monitor, desktop, mouse and keyboard and the rest are obviously things being moved around) so I believe I am royally fucked.


Not only did I under achieve this term but I also missed out on some classwork that its issue has being discussed last term so seeing it reoccur could add more fuel to the fire. I know I am stumbling on my words and missing the point but I all wanted to say is that I am really scared of what my actions have lead up to and knowing my dad I am in a certain level of physical danger. I usually try to help people with this type of issue but at this point I am slowly embracing the fact that my teenager issues are not teenager issues as much as a bunch of other stuff piling up and breaking at the smallest things, giving it the teenager label.


So many things are happening at the sametime, I am not ready for them and my Igsces are in 3 to 4 months. This is getting really scary and all of the progression and peace that I have found with myself is slowly crumbling. My old quote is now popping up again and it was:""Giving up is mans greatest treasure"" and this is slowly applying to my life.

I am too scared of the world after and it's consequences but recent events might provide me with that little push that will help me finally take control over my own life and soon to be lack of."
"I hate every single thing about myself, especially my body.","No point in beating around the bush about it. I want to kill myself because I have a small dick. And when I say small, I’m not exaggerating when it’s actually average. I’d give anything to be average sized. I’m barely just above a fucking micropenis. There’s no hope in the world for guys like me. No point in living.

Thanks for the downvotes."
Got in a wreck and i'm starting to get suicidal thoughts (21m),"Last night I got in a horrible wreck that was all my fault and I ended up hitting a car and swerving into a pole. Luckily i'm still alive with little to no injuries but my parents will not stop guilting me about it. Today I went to get the rest of my things out of my car with my dad and he was extremely pissed cause he saw how dirty my car was with clothes, food, black stains, trash bags and bottles everywhere. I admit it's disrespectful to treat a car they bought me that way but now that he saw that, he said he wont help me get another car and I work part-time and i'm a full time college student. They then lectured me all day about how immature I am and how dirty my car was and how it shows them that I don't deserve nice things. My mom then cried and said that something is seriously wrong with me cause my car had beer cans in it but I wasn't drinking and driving nor was I high when I wrecked. They still keep talking about it and it's starting to get to me as I feel completely immature, and useless as my dad keeps saying I have no common sense. My suicidal thoughts keep getting worse and Im having visions of killing myself in the closet because I absolutely hate myself now and feel like im destined to be a fuck up as my cluelessness and lack of attention has caused me to be in a wreck. I have OCD, depression, anxiety and adhd so it's hard to be in a healthy mental space but that's not an excuse for my behavior nor for what happened. I'm just getting really low mentally and Im having problems wanting to stay alive as I believe I wont be able to live on my own or hold a stable life as thats what my parents tell me almost everyday and I'm really starting to believe it. I just need help processing this and need advice on what to do as i'm still in shock and can't believe it happened."
i will do it,"i will kill myself soon,i dont wanna live i am tired to explain all but i am a burden and done so much damage to poeple i love i suck as human"
Tired.,"I'm so tired. I can't put in the effort. It doesn't seem worth it. Nothing seems worth it. I'm too scared to die, but I want to close my eyes. I've given up on trying to fix it, I'm just trying to strengthen the façade I put up. Fake it 'till you make it, right?"
Help,"I just messed up with this girl I really liked I now I feel terrible, she was the only one giving me hope to live. Now she is gone."
This is the end for me,"I've tried to extemporaneously kill myself multiple times in the last week, and I'm going to try again. This time, I will, for once in my life, succeed at something. I will expunge the failure and disgustingly paltry scoundrel that is myself.

I don't want anyone to blame themselves; the fault is my own. No one made this choice for me. It's by my own intransigence that this occurence surmised. You will all be happier without me. None of you failed me. Everyone processes things differently, and there was good intention behind each of your mental tapestries. I wish for everyone who was involved in my life to have wonderful lives. All of you are strong and capable, with vivacious potential.

My reason: I'm not capable of living in this world. All I want is to feel like a normal person, and to have a normal life—but that's unrealistic. I feel like an alien with respect to other people. I'm tired of the constant, unrelenting, internal, self-induced barrage of tirades. Where these tirades come from is essentially the cognizance that I am not a normal person. I can't remove this cognizance, and I don't think I can do anything about my abnormalities; I've been abnormal my whole life.

I wish my brain would work the way every other person's works; I hate my brain. I wish my cerebrospinal fluid was gasoline so I could set fire to it. I hate my anxiety-provoking hyperfixation with details to the point where accomplishing basic tasks becomes akin to a Sisyphus-level despair. I hate how each tarnished thought which passes through my head feels like a passing through Tartarus. I hate how I'm so incapable of asserting myself. I hate how I physically feel like shit all the time for no apparent reason. I hate the absent celerity of my internal thought processes, such that I feel mentally retarded. I hate how I'm never good enough for anything or anyone. I never will be. Especially considering my introspectively-driven tarnishment of each turbulating thought. I'm encumbered.

My family has never been particularly tight-knit. Similarly, I don't have anyone I'd consider a friend offline. Therefore, my family will forget about me, with there being no one to mourn my absence in-person. I am no one; I am incontrovertibly nothing. My online friends, likewise, will also get over me. I'm nothing special—aside from being abhorrently abnormal. Hell, I'd consider myself a terrible friend, actually—and a terrible person. My facetiousness herein, toward my friends and family, is evidence of the formers. I'm, of course, never good enough for anything or anyone, so all these assertions stand as delegated truths. All these factoids will come to fruition in my passing.

I really don't have a reason to be alive. I don't bring anything to anyone. I'm effectively useless and worthless. If anything, I bring despair to others by being an incessant burden. I'm not funny. I'm not likeable. I'm not smart. I'm not confident. I'm not good. I don't have a future. I'm not handsome. I'm not cool. I'm not organized. I'm not gregarious. I'm an embarrassment. I'm tired. I don't have any reason to care about me, and nor does anyone else.

I didn't ask to have an autistic-type disorder. I didn't ask to be so incredibly sensitive that basic human interaction causes me significant distress. I didn't ask to have my internal worldviews which are so out of tandem with society's general culture such that relating to others is paintstakingly painful. I didn't ask to have a nullified childhood and adolescence. I didn't ask to be abused by people who were supposed to care for me. And, quite frankly, I didn't ask to be born. But now I'm asking to die."
Livin in Algeria Africa,"So I live in this Muslim country where everyone is Muslim and if ur not everyone will hate you 
I got bullied at high school and been dealing with depression since then now I'm a third year student of English at university and all I want is a US tourist Visa so I can never come back,  its really bad here , I've been saving dollars ( which is not our currency) I sold my nudes to gay ppl and I reached 1000 $ 
The problem the US made it really hard to get a Visa,  they tell u u must have 3000 $ and an invitation from a us Citizen 
3000 $ is 60 million here too hard to get and mean nothing here cuz the economy is fucked up a million is nothing, its 60 $ for u 
Anyways bye"
Sometimes I think it might be easier.,"Sometimes I think that it would be easier if I wasn't here. That all my failures wouldn't hurt the ones I love. That I wouldn't be a disappointment anymore. I try, I really do. But no matter what, it feels like I let everyone important to me down."
I tired.,I jammed a razor blade into both my wrists on new years with the intention to die. It would have happened but my roommate came home and found me. Today I woke up and everything got so much worse. Again. Seriously considering hanging myself in the basement. I dont have alot of friends and the few I have are getting tired of my shit. I cant talk to my mother about this. I use to be so strong but I dont what happened to me.  I dont know why I'm even posting this I thought it was gonna help but I'm done now. What should I do? I dont have much money and I dont have insurance so I cant go check myself into somewhere. I'm lost. someone please tell me what to do.
I just want to fucking die,"I'm sick and tired of going through this bullshit that we call life. I haven't been happy for so fucking long and I have attempted suicide 3 times already and they have all failed. I really whish someone would just give me a gun so I could just blow my fucking brains out already. I have been abused mentally and physically in a relationship, I lost almost all of my friends, and when I met someone I truly was in love with she told me she never wanted to see me again and started to spread lies about me. I was already depressed before and now this shit. I made my attempt to hang myself but I was taken I to a a mental hospital for 10 days and they let me out, unknowing to them that I still feel like dying. I just can't keep this fucking shit up anymore, these memories and the loneliness is so fucking overwhelming and I just want to fucking give up already."
My life is meaningless.,"For the past few weeks, I felt dead inside. I don’t see the point in life anymore. I lost my interest on the things I used to love and enjoy. Everything is pointless to me now. And with everything that’s been happening around the world, I really don’t see my future anymore. 
I have problems which I try to run away from and I know they’ll come to bite me in the ass soon. Going to school makes me anxious and I don’t want to do this anymore. I just really feel like I’m dead inside and I want this to end. I might kill myself next month when I finally build up my courage. I know my girlfriend, a few friends, and family will be sad but the world will still keep spinning."
2020 was supposed to be my year,But I guess I’m not living to 2021 I knew I should’ve killed myself earlier it’s only getting worse
I need help but I dont know if I'm sick enough,"I've been passively suicidal since my early teens. I always thought I'd kill myself by 25. I'm 23 now, and my depression is unbearable. I'm on 200mg sertraline but I still feel worthless. Lately my thoughts of suicide have become more vivid, like how i would do it. Not necessarily a plan, but almost there. I dont know what to do. My bf is trying to help me. But my brain is rejecting all help and I'm isolating myself. Nothing seems worth it anymore I'm a failure. I dont know anymore I dont know why I'm posting here...."
I planned to kill myself yesterday,"For the past few months, I've experienced multiple deaths in my family. I've been able to block it all out for a while but yesterday I couldn't. Combined with a few other factors, I researched and researched suicide and came up with a method to do it. I went as far as looking at train times and scheduling an uber there. I just can't. I'm scared. I told a few of my friends and they all pulled back and ""need space"". I keep thinking that there really isn't anyone who loves me. I've been alive for just under 16 years now and I've never truly felt like i belonged. This year was progressive, I made so many friends but yesterday I almost ended it all and for some reason still regret not doing so. I don't know what to do. Please help me"
The bad things I've done to others won't go away,"I'm a greedy, manipulative, hypocritical and deceitful person. Not a master manipulator, but despicable all the same. The memories of making choices, including actions and non-actions with residual effects, won't go away. It's easier to see the surface level pain done to others, but there are many other actions that produced unseen or unheard pain and hurt.

I don't deserve loyalty from friends, care from family, or forgiveness from society as a whole. Choosing better doesn't change that fact.

Apologies for the incessant whining."
wow 603 online and not one person cares to talk to me lol,
I want to dissappear... I think..,I'm over this soon. Nothing is going well.. I can't keep going. There's so many ways to end this. I'm thinking about taking some pills but I don't know yet... I had to get this out of my head now. I may not do it but I just had to get it out.
i am sick of suffering,"life has become nothing but suffering, really. there's no big reason why i'd really want to live. unrequited love on two sides. i'm giving it and i'm fucking receiving it. hurting someone, and also being hurt is something that i never wanted to experience. if there is a genuine 'bane of my existence', i suppose it would be that.

it really sucks not being someone's number one, you know? especially with this person. if i can't be their number one, then i essentially believe that i'm worthless, in a sense. i don't want to live without them but i'm also not strong enough to live WITH them.

it hurts. it hurts. it hurts. it hurts. it hurts. breathing hurts. eating hurts. drinking hurts. just fucking existing day by day hurts, and for WHAT? what is the purpose of all this if it's all going to cycle back eventually anyway? why *should* i have to experience this?

i don't know. i just don't want to be alone."
vent ig?,"im alone, no one, my family nor my therapist seems to care and everything goes in such slow-mo i'm not even sure im awake anymore. i just so tired of hurting, tired of fighting this. it doesn't feel like im even taken srsly. who am i to blame? if it didn't suceed the four first times, why would it now?"
Didn't know where else to go,"I have no idea what's going on in my head. But I don't think I'm safe for myself. I don't want to kill myself, but I want to die.
I'm just 20, and I have made big mistakes career wise, and don't have the courage to start over. I've been an escapist, and I'm escaping from my current course as well, but I just feel it's wrong.
And I think I'm in love, it's super complicated, and the only solution I can think of is just erasing my existence, it'll make things easier for everyone."
What's the point in anything,"I don't have anyone who care about me. No one take take contact me and when I try, I get ignored. I have been in bed for 18 hours now, have not spoken to anyone for 2 days. So honestly what is the point of living, I just want to fall asleep again and never wake up again."
I don't want to live anymore,"Life is absolutely shit my gf is away for a week so I don't get any emotional support people constantly insult me in school and outside of school (I'm 13 coming 14 in February btw) and I just can't deal with it anymore I don't want to be alive any longer.
I've tried to kill myself multiple times failed each time due to thinking about my gf and how much she will miss me but I still want to die. Life is horrible.
I'm planning on killing myself later this week."
A friend cut me off when I divulged to her I was having suicidal thoughts,"Ok Reddit things are spurning out of control. I  put up a post on r/relationships about how I revealed to my friend about my suicidal thoughts.

 My friend said she could not help me as she's not trained for that and asked me to go to a psychiatrist. ( She knew I have feelings for her, but we still remained friends). But what she did after that was, completely cut me off, saying she can't talk/help in any way and refused to pick my calls. Her response threw me into a state of panic and we haven't talked since. I  really believed that she could have handled it better. And my psychiatrist held the same opinion. 

But as I wanted to know other's opinions, I decided to put up a post on r/relationships, and everyone on there started hating on me, calling me manipulative and exploitive. That I failed to understand boundaries. And she did what exactly a good friend would do. I don't know what to make of this, because  I was made to believe it was not my fault. My mind's running too fast again."
Having suicide as an option has given me peace of mind.,"I've screwed up a lot these past few years, my fuckups really dawned on me when I failed out of college last semester. I'm 25 and have no marketable skills, no friends, i'm a complete failure. I almost decided to just end everything on multiple occasions, but actually came really close to just doing it recently. Then I realized something, if I'm going to just end it anyways I may as well give life a real shot with no inhibitions. I'm giving myself 6 months, I'm going to try to get a job in the sales industry, to become more positive and social, to study in my off time in case I can get back into school next year. The fact that I have the option to just end everything has given me more confidence, I no longer care about how people look at me etc. Ironically the option of suicide has made it easier for me to give life my all."
I dont know what to do anymore,"(M14) I am yelled at all of the time for everything I do. I cant tell my parents how I feel because they will call me dramatic. I've been asking for help with the dog we adopted, but noone but me wanted. She and my crush are the only reasons I'm still alive right now, and they keep threatening to give the dog away. I dont know what to do anymore. And I have diabetes so that doesn't make anything better. I dont want to live, but I'm too scared of dying. Cyanide or hanging myself seem like the right thing to do right now."
What to do before I kill myself?,Not gonna bore you with the details but basically im 17 and I have no future which is why Im killing myself. Dont try to convince me otherwise the decision is already made. Ive got about a week left and I was wondering what should I do before I end it all? Is there anything that I should try/experience that is remarkable in your opinion?
I'm about to slit my throat,I'm gonna fucking do it I cant do this shit any longer I'm just a big waste of fucking space with no will left to live it's not like my family would give a fuck I can't take this shit anymore everything's going wrong and I don't feel right
"I wanted to say something to everyone who’s alone, everyone who never asked for this. Everyone that hurts and everyone that doesn’t feel like they have a purpose","I’ve been alone for the past year and a half. I lost the light of my life because I was too paranoid to keep them and when I did I lost the biggest chunk of myself. I pushed them to the edge and I took what amazing things we had and tore them down, broke her trust and in the end it was all my fault because I was too anxious. I did the exact same thing to a girl I loved not 3 months after that started and I’ve been in complete pain for the past year and a half, every day every hour, holding onto that and unable to fix anything. I don’t have a job I can do because I’ve been so mentally wounded by that to the point where I can’t do a simple task without feeling so much anxiety I get a mental breakdown full of tears and hyperventilation after the shift, making less than a hundred bucks that day. I can’t make friends because of that anxiety and I can’t even talk to people anymore the way I used to because my brain explodes when I try. I have nobody. I don’t have weed, I don’t have drinks, I don’t have friends to help. I am alone. I sat outside a church last night crying and seeing no purpose in my life, finally breaking down after a year. That light in my life is cold and they don’t care, as only a shell of what they once were thanks to me. Why am I telling you all this? 

Fuck all that. Stand the fuck up and keep going. You will feel useless every day. You will have hard days every day but you’re fucking better than that. You’re better than me. You’re better than anyone that would talk you down. You might not have someone with you talking you up, you might not have anyone there to help you. You might be the only one there to help yourself but that’s exactly fine because you’re fucking amazing and you can pull anything off if you pick yourself up and fight. Work, school, love, hope. Everything. There’s the biggest reserve of talent deep down and I don’t give a motherfuck if you don’t believe there is because there is. You can reach in and pull it out. It’s there. You’re you! That’s why you’re great! Nobody is like you. 

One day you’ll look back on this turmoil and remember how you stood up and be grateful you did because it’ll have all been worth it and you’ll be in a better place. That better place won’t be heaven cuz ya gave up. That place will be the place you got yourself to. You’re fucking awesome, ya know. Believe it

Have a great day you beautiful person."
i could literally just die right now," yeah, im going to hang out with my friend in 2 hours, but life's too painful. there's just so many regrets and traumatic memories to make life liveable. i finally found chemicals that weren't locked up, so that's fun. i have nothing to live for. in my 13 years of existing, there isn't one time i could think of happiness. hell, i don't deserve anything. i'd be so much happier if i was dead. nothing works. hospitalization, meds, and therapy are pointless for me. just let me be in peace. you wouldn't let an elder suffering from a condition that can't be cured suffer on life support, so why aren't you doing the same for me? im just another depressed, suicidal, traumatized, and anxious teen, so there's literally NOTHING to lose on Earth."

I just don't know anymore,Everything seems to be falling apart around me and so many of my problems are just getting way out of hand. I feel like a burden to everyone I'm even in the presence of and I can't seem to fix my brain no matter how hard I try or what I do. Living seems more and.more like and endless spiral of pain and I can't help but think that it's just not worth it anymore.
I gotta go,"I don’t want to be helped..I just wanna know how to...kill myself without traumatizing my new roommates who will Inevitably find me. 
Something clean and not scary to look at..

I’m really really tired 
I just want to see my mom again 
I don’t want to damage anyone 
I just want to go

Every time I try I fail
I’m tired of failing"
✌🏻,"tried to get help but that shit doesnt exist. and everything ive read “keep hanging in there” or “it gets better” is total bullshit. havent had a single person give me an even decent reason as to why i shouldnt. even my own family doesnt care they know about my issues and dont even ask me about anything or offer help they expect some miracle to strike down and heal me, but whatever at least it will be the last time im in pain."
Is this active suicidal thoughts?,"I looked it up. There’s a difference between types of suicidal thoughts with them being passive vs active. Passive is the old “I wish I wasn’t alive” and shit. The same old same old but it’s said that majority of the people think that and it’s not a big deal to fret about; it’s a normal thing when people are suffering a little more than usual. But than there’s active. Active is when u have a plan, date, ideas, and ideation of suicide. When it is active suicidal thoughts, you need help. 
I ask for a couple of reasons with the first of, do I need help? Scratch that, I’m sure I do. I‘ve got a plan and I’ve stock piled painkillers from my last surgery and I’m ready to go at a moments notice. The other reason I ask is if what I’m going through is normal? 18M, struggling with family, struggling with myself, struggling with friends, recently dumped, struggling with ADD, alone, cool enough that everybody knows me but not cool enough to be invited to parties or to hangout with friends, decent looking but nobody wants to date, might not go to the college I want and it’s no like Harvard or Stanford but the college I want is something realistic and in state and all. Long story short, these are the normal old 18M issues but what I think is not normal hence idk whether it’s right to quit because my mind isn’t right or should I persevere because my life is still on a decent (albeit undesirable) path."
"I’m not living because I want to live, I’m only living so I won’t make everyone else sad","In August of last year I tried to kill myself and I got mixed reactions from the people around me. But overall, the main thing was they would all be devastated if I had actually succeeded. So the only reason I haven’t tried it again is because I don’t want to hurt everyone else. I hate living like this though. Living just so others won’t be sad is no way to live. I’m miserable everyday and I can’t remember a time when I woke up and I wasn’t angry that I just didn’t die peacefully in my sleep. I go through the day wishing something bad would happen like a tragic car accident that only killed me or a stray bullet hitting me or something like that. I hate myself and I just wish I wasn’t here but I will continue to be here for everyone else’s sake."
Committing suicide feels like a goal I need to accomplish,Committing suicide is extremely hard and this forum is proof no matter how much your suffering your survival instinct kicks in. For me it almost feels like my last good accomplishment. It weirdly feels irresponsible to willingly accept more pain and misery that is coming my way. The right choice the difficult choice is to end this life. It’s still very hard to do. If I could carry it out I would escape all the pain in my life. Another point is how the hell do people expect someone with a debilitating mental illness to improve their lives dramatically. In therapy they are always like you have to do most of the hard work I barely can get out of bed and you want me to fix my whole life. So much maintenance goes into life too it’s not like you can fix it once and your okay it’s a daily struggle. One day I hope to be dead and then this thinking mind won’t make me feel bad about being a complete and total failure
My birthday is coming up,My birthday is coming up and all my family can do is attack and demonize me they've been doing it for years and I can't take much more of it how cool would it be to live an exact number of years I'm just sad I'll never see the big apple or get my diploma but I guess that's life if anyone I care about See's this it was a long time coming and if you had listened for more than 10 seconds instead of cutting me off mid sentence maybe things would have been different.
I have plans to kill myself in march (17),"I've been struggling with a lot of depressive and self-destructive thoughts for years now from what I can remember, it's not really mild and just a sad episode it's genuine feelings of emptiness and just wanting to close my eyes and never have to wake up again to any of this.  
I'm extremely paranoid about my friends, I feel like they all hate me and force themselves to be with me or to talk to me because otherwise, they think I'll hurt or kill myself.

Nothing feels genuine because I don't think anyone would ever want to hang out with me because of me or find me nice as a friend. Mostly because most of my childhood was of my friends treating me that way and I've never made a good experience of having a genuine friend who's just a friend.

And that makes me feel so alone and so unwanted, I'm so so scared everyone just sees me as a psychotic person they need to endure with or else they'd feel guilty over my suicide.   
I'm scared of opening up about my past trauma, I barely can trust anyone because of this.  
I want to hang myself in a local-giant forest before my 18th birthday, mainly because I want to be with dad for his birthday before I kill myself. I love him a lot but he also sees me as psychotic rather than a normal person, I know this from past conversations and the way he talks about my problems at the psychologist. My mom has abused me and I don't want to talk about that but I felt like I should mention it.

Nothing in my future seems good or just worth going through this pain, I'm at a loss what to do and I just want to hang myself. I've been crying since I woke up because my closest friends betrayed my trust yesterday and called the police on me because I was having a psychotic breakdown and talking about dying but I never said I'd try anything. 

They just called it because they didn't want to talk to me and didn't want to feel responsible for my death, that's what I think at least, am I selfish for thinking that?  
I'm just so heartbroken and shook up, none of them messaged me since yesterday either so I just feel like they truly hate me and have abandoned me. I feel like it's all my fault too that I broke our friendship and I lost one of the few things that still cheered my day up.   
I don't know what to do anymore I'm so heartbroken and just wish to die. 

I just hope I can manage to hang myself in march, I ordered proper rope and set a good time window."
I told my boyfriend I wanted to die,"He didn't want to talk to me because I sounded angry, and he took an hour to finish a game and watching videos with his friend to call me. Even after I begged. I told him how I felt even though I didn't want to and he sounded annoyed and told me to go to the doctor.

Didn't say he was worried. Or that he loved me. He's treating me like a patient. I don't think he's taking me seriously. He just tells me what to do, and I don't feel any comfort from it.

I've been reading people's stories about how it's a bad idea and how hurt I could get to ease away from it. I don't know why. I'm feeling a lot of different things right now and didn't know where to go."
Anybody else wish they could get Thanks snapped out of existence? Except with dying and not ending up in a fucking rock with everybody else who got snapped.,
Wanting to be dead but don’t want to kill myself,"I feel like this just now. I wish I was dead but I am too scared to try suicide.

I am basically a pathetic mess of a person. I found out on New Years Day my partner of 14 years was having an affair so I left home. 

I started a big new job a week later and frankly, I can’t cope. I hate the job so far but I think that’s because I hate change, responsibility and new stuff - which this all is!

I am struggling so much and I can’t talk to anyone. People care but keep trying to say things will be ok. Things ARE NOT OK. I don’t see how they can be again.

I want to die so much. To just not be here and deal with all this. I worry about my parents though, they are older and would be devastated.  I wish I could die in an accident, I thought about swimming in the sea and getting hypothermia and then I just feel shit because I am so fucking stupid for thinking these things.

Does anyone else feel like this? Not actually wanting to commit suicide but wanting to die?"
It’s over I think,"I (19M) am bipolar but no pills make any effect. Cut off my ex gf (who with I had a 4yrs relationship). No friends, my family lives in another city not any close. I live alone. 
Really don’t know what to do..."
i want to die,"i will kill on my brithday, april 26th. I will be 16 years old. I just can't live anymore. I can't sleep longer than 4 hours. Every day i want to die. There are no things that make me happy. I can't leave my bed and im useless."
I feel so alone,"Even though I am constantly surrounded by people I feel like I am in solitary confinement and that I am screaming at 4 hollow walls because some people see right through me and always tell me to get help but I feel like this isn't what I really need. I just want a few things in life and they are just my dads approval and affection, someone to love and someone to cuddle me, good grades, stable mood and not a constant victim of mood swings. So far I have nothing to look ahead for except overdue work and a looming schedule filled with exams that fuck all people worldwide equally. I have become such a failure to the point where I can't even express my emotions and problem clearly"
Please help me!!!!,Can i get someone to talk to. My life is a wreck and i keep making mistake after mistake. I even failed at killing myself
MyLifeRn,Am I the only one who wakes up everyday and stare at the ceiling thinking like damn another shitty day and gotta start socializing to people that doesn't even care to you? And thinking why am I even alive when I'm gonna die anyway.... It's like everything is so boring and you're feeling empty inside like every action and your existence is pointless😧😧😧 I really need help yikess I'm pathetic as F because I wish I was never born in this world😢
I just tried to kill myself,Imagine popping nine percs than ten minutes later you puke em our then use all the narcan  you have left. I’m hiding in my room from my mom. I feel like shit
i'm a monster,"ive done horrible things in the past that i'm not proud of. i'm attracted to children and cant find a way to stop that even with a year of therapy. i also have terrible anger issues and am worried i might hurt someone. i have autism, i was physically assaulted as a child by my father, i dont have a social life, i love animals but wasnt aware i was harming them for so many years, i just watched a documentary called earthlings, i dont know how i'll forgive myself for the harm ive caused to animals and people alike. is there any way i can have a swift easy death like a pill or euthanasia? suicide would be a fitting punishment. people are always telling me that"
I think I’m gonna relapse.,"I [17, F] have been depressed for as long as I can remember. I’ve had 2 suicide attempts just this year, have been in a psych ward once and have been on meds since September of this year.

It’s been going fairly well, I even got to a point where I had no suicidal thoughts for a few weeks straight, but now it’s all coming back.

I don’t even feel like taking my meds anymore and I’m just thinking about ending it all asap (would try February 2nd, but it’s a Sunday, so my parents will be home unless some miracle happens and they decide to leave).

I also think I might be falling into an eating disorder (I’m currently 5kg underweight and still want to go lower), I’m extremally boring I have no hobbies and I’m unatractive, and I’ve fallen for a girl who will probably never see me as a potential partner, due to me being an absolute awkward loser (my psychiatrist suspects I might be autistic, heh). Her birthday is on February 1st and I’ve been wondering if I should confess to her then, but I’m worried that if she says no and then I try to kill myself sometime later she will blame herself for it :(

I don’t know what to do... Just kinda came here to vent and maybe get some tips... Thanks for reading 🤍"
I feel like dying would be the best option,"I feel terrible all the time, especially when I think about studying and university. I feel like an absolute   
ungrateful brat because so many people would love to be in my position and have the opportunities that I have, and I'm wishing to not be here in this place or anywhere at all. Before just now, I've really only thought about how I wish something were to happen to me so that I would die, but now I'm actively thinking about killing myself. 

&#x200B;

About therapy, I do go to a therapist through university counselling but I don't want to talk about suicidal thoughts with her because she is obligated to report it which I don't want."
Hi,"dont know why im sad but i am i am not bad looking i jave friends and i was raised by good people who were very good to me i have nothing to be sad about i dont know if im sad just to be sad or if im really sad i just want someone who will understand me but i feel like im alone no matter wherre i go i have friends but they are not ""real friends"" they dont know the truth that every day i wake up and just want to die i dont want any of it i dont want a wofe or a child or a future i just want eberything to be black i dont want heaven or bliss i just want to not know i even existed and it sucks because i am so disconnected from everyone and everything my famuly and friends maybe im the only one that feels this way maybe im not but ill always believe that im alone and that id the worst part"
What is your reason for wanting to end it NOW?,"So, consider this. In few years, half of the population will die because of impact of unknown meteorite and mutated creatures will start appearing, humanity will fight against them because of changes in reality created due to dimensonal rip, their bodies will become stronger, healthier.

Or we will experience zombie apocalypse. Or a virus. It doesn't matter. 

I was suicidal quite a long time now, but one of the reasons I stopped was because of this. I would absolutely hate dying just before te show starts.

&#x200B;

My question is, what situation are you in that you want to kill yourself NOW? I'm curious, I am not saying that there are no reasons for the immediate end, but if you think you have them, mind sharing?

PS: I love you and hope this can bring different perspective to your life. <3"
"Suicidal thoughts are developing in my head. I have a girlfriend, friends, and family who care and love for me. I need help.","While not being very severe as of now, some suicidal thoughts are creeping into my mind. the reason being is that I keep feeling like no matter how hard I work, no matter what I do or how optimistic I force myself to be, I feel like nothing more than an utter failure and my dreams will never come close to being a reality. 

To give you some context, these past few months have been rough for me. Currently, I am unemployed and have been struggling to find a job for weeks now. I don't have a car so my choices are incredibly limited. What I'm doing wrong I don't know. My strongest guess is that my Aspergers is to blame. I say things I don't mean or I just completely twist my wording. It's always been incredibly annoying and I hate it. Couple this with a few other mental issues of mine that have ruined my life from day one and you can kind of see the mess I'm in. that or maybe I'm giving up too soon. 

I still have money in the bank but it's slowly shrinking by the day. It won't last long and I'm still struggling for a job. I feel like an absolute loser because of this. I'm only 19 but already I've fucked up bad in life and don't have much money to my name. 

The other thing that has me being weighed down is my dream to be a writer. For you see, since sophomore year of high school I had been creating a science fantasy universe of my own creation. Several years I've worked on this and I want to see my dream of it blossom become true. Yet no matter how hard I try, no matter what method I use...I can't get anyone to even bother giving my work a chance. It always feels like I'm just fucking terrible or that I'm cursed. Like some entity I cannot see is torturing me by ruining my chances at any breakthrough, beating me down with terrible luck. I've invested in so much money towards concept art and everything and yet still nothing. It's like I'm screaming but I don't realize I'm buried 6 feet into the earth. That or no one will bother to listen to me because my stuff is that utterly terrible so I don't even deserve to be acknowledged. 

All this together has put me into a deep depression that I've hidden away from everybody so they wouldn't worry. I'm too scared to bring them into this fearing that I'll just drag them into this pit of hell I've dug myself into. It feels like everything is my fault and I'm going to be a constant failure no matter what. I'm destined to fail. Destined to be another insignificant piece of garbage on the side of the road. My future is so uncertain that I'm terrified and I don't know if I want to witness to the horror I've put myself in. My life feels like a downward spiral of failure and loneliness and I'm helpless to stop it. 

I really don't want to kill myself. I'm fucking scared. But the temptation is real and I can feel it growing stronger as the very earth crumbled beneath my feet. Bullet to the head, a noose around my neck, I'm not sure how I'll do it but I'm just scared. I don't want to because I'd hate to put everyone I care about through that misery. Yet at the same time, I feel my own pain is unbearable. It's this agonizing civil war in my mind that just won't stop. 

Nothing feels right anymore. Everything feels hopeless. However, I am still wanting to hear a voice of reason so have at it. Because at this point, what do I have to lose? I've gained nothing."
The only thing that comforts me is the certainty that I will kill myself.,"I am 28 years old I suffer from depression and several other mental problems since I was 16 years old, I tried several treatments it didn't work it was only getting worse mainly in the last 2 years today I am a failure, I made mistakes and failed in everything in life I am at my worst moment, I don't have nothing else that ties me to this cruel and unjust world."
I don’t deserve the life I was given I should just end it,I’m only 20 but I’ve done nothing good with my life I have no future and I wasted all my teen years on one girl that I still can’t get over I just want to end my life because every day without her is misery and I can’t stop thinking about her I just want the pain to end
Want to kill myself,I’m so close to killing my self today feeling so upset and down
Sunday evening,"I have the pieces I need to start a better life and it is still not working out. I just think of suicide every day. In some occasions I might try it and never succeed. Otherwise I would not be writing this haha... I want to do it, I want to end my life today. I want to end my life now. I always held on. Honestly I wonder how I did not go insane with the life I have had. Unfortunately someone's departure was enough to blow everything up. I do not know why I try better. I just do somehow. I do not want to anymore. He thinks running away could be a turning point in my life. In his life it perhaps was, but in mine it is just a long breakdown that will lead to the same end no matter how hard I try. He thinks I would have grown out of what he did when he ran away. He is mistaken.  It fucked my life up. More than it ever was. But I guess that is how it is to be a collateral damage.  Everything starts seeming merciless. Morals, even if I never believed in them as more than a human conception, become despicable. I contempt them. All I got from that is a constant feeling of being the victim of some kind of cruelty even when I use my logic to realize he needed to save himself and I should stay strong now. Emotions barely obey to logic yet they know how to make it powerless. Right now my logic sense is powerless. All I can think of is to end my life."
Pretty sure tonight’s the night,Not sure why I’m posting this. Maybe some part of me wants to find a reason to keep going. I’m going to be leaving behind all my friends and leave them in a financial hellhole. But I can’t keep feeling like this. I can’t do it anymore.
It just seems inevitable,"I’ll never be any better off than I am now. I’ll never be attractive or interesting enough for a partner or friends, so I’ll always be alone. I won’t ever have the education or skill set to make good money, so I’ll always be in poverty. 

Life will just get worse with each passing day. I just feel that suicide is where my life will end up. So why waste a bunch of time staying alive and miserable when I can take the pain away tonight? I see no other options for myself."
not a long time,"i always tell myself im here for a fun time, not a long time. but now i dont even have fun times, ive cut everyone off and now im alone like ive been feeling. i just want it to end but i cant bring myself to do it."
Slit my neck,"I dont care if I die
Or if I live.i just want to slit my neck and be gone.
They have a happy life. I'm here rotting away. Because of me. It's all just me. All in my head. All in my head so I want to cut my head away. I wish I wish I could just see some blood and see some peace because surely I have punished myself then??? God I'm trying so hard not to self harm but it's either sh or fucking die I dont know what to do"
I really can’t take it anymore- Death is my only way out,"I can’t take it anymore, I have panic attacks and anxiety all the time ... I listened to everyone that told me not to do it but I’m living in hell ... life is too tough for me"
No one would know.,"If I were to kill myself tonight not one person would care. No one would know. No one cares if I were to go missing.
I'm sure maybe a few would cry fake tears to act like they cared, we all know those. It just really sucks to know that if I killed myself, not one person would care or even know.

AND that hurts."
How do you stop the pain?,"I am once more at my limit. Whenever I reach this point, I strongly consider ending it all just to stop the pain and anguish. It starts emotionally, then mentally, and eventually physically. A pain in my thoughts, and my chest that I am trying to endure daily but I am getting so weak now. I don't know what I want from posting here. I posted here before and got to talk to someone who knew what to say at the right time. Now, it just feels like I'm posting here because I want some people to know what happened if the day comes. I don't want to write a note for the people who know me. I just want to be gone. Tonight just might be the night. Thanks to the people in this community who stayed with me when I had no one in the middle of the night. These people literally saved my life those nights with just words from thousands of miles away. I got to experience more good days because of you people."
Is suicide a good idea?,"I have been sat down at my computer and I haven't eaten all day. I am starting to get quite tired of everything really, I can't explain it very well without getting aggressive but life is starting to feel suffocating. It's not so much that there is anything unbearable going on seeing as I am taking a year off, but just living in general seems to be unbearable for no reason. All I have to do is sit still without any sensory input and I slowly start to feel complete despair, if I try anything to distract myself I can't see any purpose or meaning behind what I'm doing. I have been on an exercise program for six days but that hasn't really changed the way I feel at all, whether before during or after exercising.

When I try explaining it it simply seems to cause a lot of harm to everybody else. My ability to communicate in general is impaired. I don't feel like I really have any purpose outside of giving up on everything in life, I cannot see any meaning in the other options.

I am quite sick of being alive. I don't understand why I should carry on. It's pointless and I can't find any pleasure in anything. I don't really understand this situation as a whole.

I don't really have any faith in the Samaritans thing Google suggests because I already hate phone calls/interaction and based on my personal experience most conversations simply leave me dissatisfied or worse off. My family members try deflecting it and health professionals just seem apathetic towards me. I don't really know what I should do but I feel horrible, as-in the most horrible I've ever felt in my whole life, but even things that used to help have lost any emotional or health impact on me.

I don't see why I should live if I am unable to experience any sense of purpose or happiness."
I am very close to suicide,"I had hoped to die many times, but now I have to go to it."
What the fuck am i supposed to do,I've been trying really hard this last year to improve myself. I've been trying so hard and I was doing better for a while but in the end I'm back where i started. What the fuck is the ppint i cant accomplish anything. Im stupid and physically weak and unattractive and poor and i cant name a aingle good quality about myself. I havent improved at all. Nobody gives a shit
Why do I always have to end up alone an unwanted? This isn't fair 😭,"I hate my life. I have no one at all. I feel so far away from everyone. I feel like I'll never find anyone. I'm on my desperate cry. I don't know if I'm going to make it through this year. I don't want to live like this, and I refuse to. I have no friends, no girlfriend, and I'm a pathetic piece of shit. Everyone always talks down to me. I'm mutilating myself again. No matter how hard I try, I will always loose the war to loneliness. No girls want to be with a guy who's depressed as I am. I fuckin hate myself for not killing myself when I had the chance to. I'm most likely going to really kill myself, and I'll die the same way I lived. Scared, alone, angry, and nothing but hate coming from."
Anyone else just accept that theyre going to have to end it soon.,"Im straight up just not having a good time. 

Ive let some issues build for about 3 years now, and have done enough damage to my life that my future would be severly impacted.

I have yet to really face any consequences for those actions (just to make it clear nothing illegal or anything that affects another person), but I would give it 2 months max before my life really just comes crashing down hard.

Do I wait to end it after that happens or should I just fucking do it now"
being on the border of being suicidal is weird,"i don’t want to kill myself, but i wish i wanted to. does that make sense? probably not.

things are looking up, but i’m just so fucking tired. i don’t like living, but i don’t want to die. i sort of flip-flop between liking life and not. i wish i could just pick one."
I couldn't do it. But I still sick to my stomach today.,"As soon as I turned the kitchen lights off my dogs started freaking out. I went over to sit at the kitchen table with the knife beside me. I held it to my neck repeatedly and the dogs were jumping up and pawing my hand away from my neck. Then one of them just sat by my feet and wouldn't leave.

Maybe it sounds stupid to people who have attempted in the past but I never have and this was the closest to breaking point I've been in a long time.

An hour or so later I brought the knife upstairs with me. I closed my eyes and gripped the blade part tight with my hand as if something was willing me on to do that. I just focused on the pressure of the blade against the flesh of my palm.

I didn't sleep well at all naturally. Then I couldn't get up. Its 3pm and I've just made coffee.

I threw up twice yesterday because of a combination of anxiety and not being able to eat.

In the last 3 days I haven't taken my antipsychotic  & I know that's why I feel physically dead and is probably the main thing causing the nausea and the not sleeping. But I realised my dreams are different when I don't take the meds. They're simpler but way more meaningful. The kind of dreams that run on a loop in that half awake half asleep state.

I'm exhausted. I know I'm very stupid. I used to take my meds every single night for the past year at least. Then I realised this zombified emotionless being isn't me. I'd rather go crazy because at least then I'd feel something.

I'm in a really bad way. I feel like I failed last night. I couldn't go through with it. I feel like I will try again. Tomorrows Monday which means doctors and all that stuff will be open. But how on earth do I tell a doctor what I did without them locking me up? I'm tired of it. I just want to leave and see what, if anything, is on the other side. Maybe it's better than the suffering here."
My friend passed five months ago and I want to join them,"I'm really hating university. I'm fucking up so terribly. I miss them so, so much; they comforted me during an awful time in my life. We knew each other online for five years. We said we were sisters.

I can sit here and know that what I am thinking of doing, that what I will do when I kill myself, is selfish. And yet I just keep on thinking—what's wrong with selfish? I try and try and try to be there for people and I failed my friend, and they're gone. Here I try and try to be supportive and good and I fail miserably. I want to go to the lake and drown, I want to cut myself up until I bleed and bleed, and yet the friend who left me here is the one that I keep thinking of to keep going.

I don't want to keep going anymore. I keep thinking of what they might say. They would laugh if I told them why I'm like this, probably; they laughed at me for being melodramatic. I don't think they would want me to, but I want to so fucking badly. I want to end it. I've been scratching my skin and hitting my head trying to feel something and I feel nothing, and I desperately want all this pain and emptiness and shit to be over."
I'm Ending This Tonight,"I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY, JUST FOR GOD'S SAKE

#STAY WITH ME

(Im sobbing)

[For you, r/suicidewatch]. 

After I try pain, if pain doesn't stop me.... I'm 100% ready to die,  I am doing the full arsenal. Everything in my power to die. If I do not or cannot die, then I will live 110% of every piece of life. If only I did not have to be alone.. God, help me.

[From self harm]. 


It'll be new, boiling soup and dripping it on my arm. I don't know. I got the idea at work. I wanna see if replaced cutting better than relationships, better than family, better than reading or art,   better than walks, hugs, tears,   better than belief in  something greater.. Better than beauty, then each breath I take, with someone, a witness to my life as I wanted to be to theirs.. Better than whatever this is. In this chair, useless as fuck and unloved forever... It'll be new and maybe better, and maybe not. But what's my crime? People, what's my reason God forgot  me? What's the reason life *hurts* in here. In HERE [my chest, my body? Under my cuts not on them, in my feelings, emotions., dreams and desires, in the swallowing of meals,   watching the ladies in skirts walk past and never look twice at this loser, ]  but it'll be new, right? And it'll get better, right? And i can stop crying.....right?? When no one can walk beneath autumn trees with me, and I live the life of Afterwards? After my rape, after a death, another death, homelessness, and rejection in every way, as if of every single possible porn angle ! I give up??.??.*i give up.    Save me whoever is out there, help me God. I give up. I am done.."
I’ve thought about suicide every single day for over 12 years.,I turn 25 in a few days. That’s like half my life. I just want it to be over
no title,I wonder why a piece of shit like me actually wants some relief in 'this side' of living
Method question.,Sorry I posted impulsively didn't read the rules first
I think I might have sexually assaulted someone and feeling of guilt is killing me,"So yesterday I was going through chat messages I had with one of my friends and came across a photo that reminded me of a horrible thing that I did years ago. Thing that I wish never happened. Photo was taken on a last high school trip we had. We were staying at a hotel. One evening me and one of my friends were walking down a hallway and noticed that the doors of one hotel room were open. It was a room where two of our female classmates were staying. We got inside of the room and noticed that one of our female classmates was sleeping on the bed tucked in blanket. For whatever reason we thought it would be funny if each of us got on bed and the other took a photo of it. So I got on bed, lay beside her and awkwardly put my arm across her and my friend took a photo after wich I got up and took a photo of my friend doing the same thing. We didn't sexually grab her, touch her nor did we intend to do anything like that. We just thought it would be a funny photo. Which it wasn't at all.

So yesterday I came across this photo and didn't find it funny at all. It was creppy and inappropriate behaviour and I felt really awful about doing this. I have no idea what me or my friend were thinking at the time. I guess we thought it would be some kind of a funny prank. Looking back at it it was completely inappropriate and ever since I saw the photo I have felt this terrible burden and shame because of what we did. I fell too much shame to really talk to anybody about this so I wanted to confesse here. Guilt that I feel has really paralyzed me for the past couple of days.  It’s all I can think about.

I would really like to apologize to her but Im not sure how. I cant remeber if we ever showed her the photo and it would probably make her feel really uncomfortable if I brought it up to her now. She probably doesn't even remember the photo but I feel this obligation to talk to her and apologize. I can't see myself living with this secret without apologizing to her."
Time to say goodbye.,"I know it's not fair to the few people that love me, but after I see them both on Monday, I'll find a way to end it Tuesday night. 

Hoping for as painless as possible, but I just can't keep trying or pretending anymore.

I can't enjoy myself on the weekends, I barely get out of bed. I use up all of my energy pushing myself through the work week. Everyone in my life deserves better, so I'll make sure they aren't held back by me by just ending it all."
Pussing out of suicide is ruining my life further,I dont care about my future because i plan to kill myself but then the future comes and i have no idea what todo because i pussied out of suicide and now because i dont know what todo i think of suicide even more. Forever looping snowballing. Right now i have no job and no education and my social life is on its death bed.
Depression Ends,"Alone..
Feel so so alone 
I could do it now 
I never thought that l would or could
But l understand now , it's clear 
you just have to be in pain long enough 
to get to this point 
Wouldn't b missed
My children dont care 
They b sad, but dont need me 
Not anymore , but my
grandies might
I annoy some incredibly 
No matter what l do or say 
The barbs are always sharpened and aimed 
It hurts sooo much
I annoy everyone and am just tolerated
by most 
Don't want mine to find me ..let someone else
So disappointed that lm so easily sunk 
Blown down by every passing emotion 
Weak really 
No reliliance at all
Or just a sign that lm not quiet better yet
OR is this as good as it gets 
No motivation 
In the dark 
Feels like 
Nothing is important 
Nothing at all
But ending the pain ."
Welp im gonna do somethin,So ill suicide by feb13 and yup as a meme so feb 14 yup flowers
I just want to visit the next Hospital and ask for artificial coma till i die,
I dont want to be bored any longer,"What's the point of life, there's nothing to do. My whole life has been me just sitting around being influenced by bullshit online. There's not even one aspect of my life left that isn't completely influenced by random shit ive seen online. I wake up evwry day and go online all day and even when I try to get back into school whats the fucking point. I can look at my phone all day or go finish my degree and take useless accounting classes that make me want to kill myself or go work a job that makes me want to kill myself.  I haven't had friends since I was 10 years old or younger, I have autism, Ive been sexually trafficked and seen the worst of the world. But I have hobbies, talents, a comfy home life, and im pretty privileged which in the end just makes me feel even more guilty and ashamed of existing. And I feel guilty that somehow so much bad shit happened in my life like child trafficking when i was coming from a place of privilege. nobody has understanding or sympathy for me because I didnt get kidnapped and wasnt homeless. I try to go to treatment for child trafficking and everyone has sad stories about their parents selling them or really bad things like being held at gunpoint.   no resources are geared toward me. I pass as normal enough for nobody to give a shit and blame me but im too mentally ill to actuaoly do anything. same with my autism its mild enough that nobody gives a shit and blames me for everything that goes on even though im trying as hard as i can. at the end of the day the bad of the world outweighs the good"
How do i help an online friend?,"There is this guy that i know, we’ve met through the game, just today he sent me along with few other close friends goodbye texts, saying that he’s gonna end it all today. What can I do in this kind of situation? We are all worried sick  but we live in a completely different place in the world, I have some basic information: city, name, pictures. None of us is able to contact this dude since he sent us that."
I’m only 16 but help me,Everyone tells me “you have good life ahead of you “ but I don’t know how much longer I can wait for the pain and suffering to end before I end it myself
I’m so alone... someone.. please.. help me...,
I qualify for medically assisted suicide. How do I convince my loved ones to be supportive about my decision to move forward with it?,"I'm 33F. I've recently been diagnosed with a long list of mental illnesses. It is both a relief and a disappointment. On the one hand what I've been feeling since I was a child has been validated. On the other hand it is confirmation that I will never be able to climb out of this hole. I will never stop feeling like this. And as I get older it gets worse. My diagnosis qualifies me for medically assisted death in the Netherlands (I live in North America). I've thought about both telling my loved ones before I go and not telling them. I think they'd never get over it if I didn't tell them so, as difficult as it may be, I'd rather be up front with them and at least try to get them on board with the idea. How do I even start a conversation like that? What do I say to my mom & dad? Additionally, I don't have a will as I don't have any assets other than savings in cash. I don't have any children or other dependents. I'm single. What arrangements, other than funeral arrangements do I need to think about making before I go?"
Probably going to end my life soon.,"As I am typing this, I currently have almost 50 pills of differing types laid out in front of me. I've recorded my last words, typed my final goodbyes, except for this one to those who will see it. I'm 18, in 3 months I would have been 19. Currently have a job at Best Buy. And am not going to college because it's too expensive. I did live with my parents up until around a month ago, where I was kicked out and moved in with my grandparents. 

My girlfriend of 2 years and 8 months broke up with me last week, and I've come to terms with that. There was a lot I didn't do in the relationship that I could've done better. There were things we could've communicated better. We did not, and after a long history of depression, I finally wish to take my final step.

 I looked into the LD50s for some of these pills, and I'm taking enough for a 200 lb man to be able to die. I really hope I don't wake up tomorrow and have to go to work, since that alone would push me even farther over the edge. 

If anyone does respond to this before I do pass out, I might see it. I don't know when I specifically will, but at least I'll read some of it. 

For the rest of you out there, keep pressing forward if you can. Might not always be good but at least you're alive yknow? I've just dealt with enough to where I don't wish to be.

Edit as of 1:33 PST, all pills are down and I await my slumber."
I don’t think I can go on too much longer,"I don’t think I’m gonna make it to senior year, I’ve got someone dependent on me, my mum, she has ms, my dad works a full time job, I’m scared, somebody please help me I’ve lost myself and can’t find me, please SOMEBODY GOD HELP ME"
I’m getting worse,I feel numb and I just want to stop feeling this way. I’m just suffering
I’ve always wanted to die.,"My entire life I never really had love from my parents. (which sob cry i guess, like who really has.) the closest i got was with my biological dad who disowned me when he found out i was gay. 

I’m 26 stuck at home working and going to school full time. I have a wonderful, beautiful girlfriend. I have an incredible group of friends. But my parents can’t stand me. Especially my stepdad. 
I’ve gotten screamed at more times than I really should have by him when I was growing up. To the point where I developed selective mutism until high school. I have wanted to die every single day. It’s insane you know? how never really having parental love can mess you up. He and my mother both use me as the families scapegoat. i’m so tired reddit. I would vent to my siblings but they’re young. I don’t want to burden them with all of this. I feel bad enough telling my best friends about it. 

The only things stopping me from finally doing it are my friends, my siblings, my girlfriend, and my cat. Otherwise I would end it. I would end it all right now and I think then I’d finally have peace.

I’m so sad.
I’m so tired.
I just want to rest.
I just want to sleep.

I’m so sorry."
26/01/2020,"I come here a lot. I just keep losing my log-ins, so I make new accounts.

I really kinda wanna die tonight.

I'd think that that'd make me happy.

But, there are things to be done.

I want to have the few experiences that I think matter, before I do, and I want to believe that they're attainable, I really do, I just . . . it is so fucking hard. Why is it so fucking hard?

I want things to be okay, and everything has just seemed fucked-up and warped for so long.

I don't to be alive longer than I have to be, but I don't want to have to be, you know?

I want to be at peace at the end, and I think that that's only attainable by chasing experiences that are not within reach, so I must make peace with not being at peace, which is something that I really don't want to do.

I don't know why I'm worse today compared to other days, but I've been worse than where I am now, and I'm afraid that I'm going to get there again.

I am afraid that after having had tried and failing at a suicide attempt before, then resolving to debase myself a little longer for some chance of something that would have made my life worthwhile, I will soon realize that that resolution was pointless and foolish and naive, just a waste of time and a cause for needless pain.

I am afraid that I will be trying to commit suicide again, and forcing myself to come to terms that, at the end of it, the experiences of my life were at worst, debasing, frightening, and torturous, and at best, well, to be honest, I'm not sure what the best would be. 

Things never really felt like they were good, but they did always feel like they could be, and now I am losing that.

I wish I wasn't, and that I didn't have to."
