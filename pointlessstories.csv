0,The Announcement of the Return of the Weekly(ish) Pointless Question/Whatever-I-Decide (but probably Pointless Question) Threads,"What's this? One of Thortron's iconic weekly(ish) pointless question threads?

No, it's not. I don't even know why you would think it was, since the title clearly states this is just the announcement of the return of those threads.

*ANYWAY*

Hello, /r/PointlessStories storytellers! You haven't seen much of me in awhile, because blah-blah work and life; however, I have come to announce the return of those threads I make that ~5-10 people on average interact with.

What can you do to be ready? Submit suggestions for posts here and be recognized as the person that submitted that question, eagerly anticipate **January 6th, 2020** and the Return of the Weekly(ish) Threads, and not quit Reddit before that date."
1,What made you a Pointless Storyteller? The RETURN of the Pointless Question Thread [Weekly(ish) Pointless Question Thread],"Some of you may have thought that I had forgotten about the magnificent return of the pointless question thread, since it is the evening of the 6th in Western Hemisphere and the 7th elsewhere. Luckily, I never specified *when* on the 6th the return would happen. Anyway, I'm home from work and it is time to ask all of you a question: what made you a pointless storyteller?

To elaborate, in this thread we are talking about what brought you to our humble subreddit, why you stayed in this subreddit, or what sculpted you into a pointless storyteller. Feel free to interpret this question in other ways, but only if you comment and elaborate on that interpretation. Otherwise, I will be incredibly disappointed in you, and possibly even shake my head with a frown.

For me, I think I have always been a pointless storyteller. If anything, I would say that I had to learn how to tell pointed stories. Thankfully, this is a place where pointed stories are ***ILLEGAL***, and so I can just be myself. I would go into more detail, but I'm on a time crunch and also hungry.

Okay, I'm going to make dinner now."
2,Let me tell you about the time I accidentally ended up with a cult of middle schoolers worshipping me.,"During my senior year of high school, I volunteered as a mentor for middle school robotics. I would walk around to the different groups, asking leading questions, offering advice, and checking in on their progress. This was all well and good until one group of 7th graders decided that robotics time was just social time. The teacher who ran the LEGO robotics club told me to keep close watch over them and make sure they were using their time productively.

Instead of using their time productively, they decided that I was far more interesting than building a competitive LEGO robot. I started exchanging tidbits of conversation with them for productivity (e.g. “make the robot successfully complete two missions and I’ll tell you about my pet guinea pig”). This worked, but at a price.

They started considering me a friend and getting to know me, and I was happy to be a role model and an older sister character to them, but then *they got OBSESSED***.** I’d like to strongly emphasize that I did nothing to spur this on, but it started with stalking. They found my schedule on the school database and would come find me during my free periods. They’d try to drag me to their classes. They found my biology teacher and begged her to tell them what grade I had in her class.

Then, the religious cult stuff started. They said that if they didn’t talk to me every single weekday they would be “cursed.” They made a song about sacrificing themselves into a volcano for me and me reviving them. They made an altar to me. I did not attempt to encourage this behavior, nor did I suggest any of it. They just did this of their own accord. It got to the point where the school administration had to intervene because their behavior violated school rules. They slowly backed off on the cult thing after admin stepped in but it still took a whole year for them to fade out of my life. Anyway, it made for a rather memorable high school experience…"
3,One of my coworkers has the same name as me and also looks the same as me,"Not completely, like we both have long blond hair but his is straight and mine is wavy, we're both pretty thin and average height, but I've got a couple inches on him, plus he's ""punk thin"" and I'm ""distance runner thin"" if that makes sense, we both have beards but his is a goatee and mine is just a regular short beard, and he's usually wearing a leather jacket and jeans, while I'm typically in a t-shirt and ""athleisure"" shorts (yay for extremely casual dress code workplaces, and also having the Scottish gene that allows me to wear no clothes in the winter). People always think we're related, but we're not.

I've kicked around a few ways for people to differentiate between us. For instance (using John as a placeholder name) ""John C"" and ""John W."" Clear enough, but lacking in flair and a little inefficient. ""Guitar John"" and ""Piano John"" (we're music teachers). Not bad, but not terribly useful as we both teach both instruments, plus it has all the flow of a drum kit falling down a flight of stairs. ""Big John"" and ""Little John."" Technically correct, but ""Big John"" still being about 30 pounds under the average weight of an American man just doesn't feel right. ""Metal John"" and ""Ska John,"" eh, maybe, but the flow is a lot worse with our actual name. My favorite idea right now is to call him ""Shaggy,"" because he kind of looks like Shaggy from Scooby-Doo, and me ""Scooby,"" partly because *obviously* and partly because one time in university running club, we ran to this one spot on the river near campus where people liked to go swimming, and I jumped in the river with much the same energy (and appearance) as a golden retriever jumping in a pool, thus earning myself the nickname ""Dog Boy.""

In any case, this is never going to cause any confusion or get old."
4,Horror TV show sound design had me laughing in the dark,I’m at home playing a game and listen to one of those horror tv shows that dramatize people’s “real” stories. I don’t typically believe in the kind of stuff but still get freaked out watching the shows because I get really into them. I’ve got my headphones on because my wife is asleep on the couch. The tension is building and one of those whispering sound effects starts. It’s supposed to be one of those creepy breathing noises but instead it just sounds like a grown ass man whispering “reeeeeeeeee”. Nothing has ever taken me out of the moment faster. I laughed out loud. Thankfully I did not wake my wife.
5,Found used red panties in the middle of the sidewalk,"So, my friend and I went to Philadelphia yesterday to see the auto show. My friend had never been to Philly, so we also stopped at a few places. It was crazy to think there was a huge mixture of people taking the term “city of brotherly love” literally and being the nicest city folks I’ve met, while simultaneously I saw the grossest things ever.

I saw a street performer almost get into a fight with a street vendor over “corners“. I saw some guy get aggressive with his waiter over wanting his burger to not have buns (trust me, you can just say it once the waiter understood. Not to mention Hard Rock Cafe has gluten-free buns if you want. That’s what I got). 

Alternatively My friend wanted to see the Rocky statue, and there was a huge line to take a photo for it. So we waited, and realized there were some people at the front who were taking pictures for you. I was a little skeptical because I had heard of instances of this where they tried to charge you. However, these people weren’t. They were just trying to get the line going and making sure someone was there to take a picture. I just wanted to take a quick picture of my friend, because I don’t really have a connection with the movies. I insisted that I just wanted to take a quick picture of him, and the guy was like “aw but sweetie why wouldn’t you want one! You look very nice”. After a while he did let it go, and we got our picture quick when we got to the front of the line, and left quick. The tourists in Philly are also not as bad as other cities, The crowds were not as bad. Most people were understanding.

However, I think the best thing that happened, was we were walking around the George Washington monument outside of that art museum With the Rocky statue. We decided to not go into the museum, but rather walk around since we had a long drive home. As we were walking back, we saw some thing red in the middle of the Sidewalk. Apparently my friend thought it was a handkerchief that you tie around a dogs neck, that must’ve gotten dropped. I thought it was boxer briefs, that somebody just left for a gag. As we walked by, skirting as far away from it as possible, it looks like some poor drunk girl with a really nice Victoria’s Secret panties had just dropped them off right there. Very used, and very disturbing. I think it was the highlight of my trip."
6,Wait for the pun,"My freshman year of college I started at my first job, in a cafe on campus. One day, about a week or two in, we ran out of milk and so someone would have to go across campus to another location to borrow some and bring it back. As the newest employee and also the youngest, I was chosen... yay. 

Important details here to imagine the hilarity. I forgot to take off my hair net before leaving. I was wearing rubber clog looking no slip shoes, black pants, and a canvas material large grey shirt that went below my knees as there wasnt one in my size. It was also August and HOT. 

So, in all my cafe uniform glory, set off across campus with our cart to get the milk. Bear in mind campus was still very new to me and as I went I realized I didnt know how to get back using ramps. 

I get to the other location and they gave me like 8 jugs of milk and I stack them on to my little cart and start walking, trying to find a way back without stairs. Meanwhile I'm pulling this rickety cart on this cobblestone road making these annoying noises, trying to balance all this milk, and everyones staring and I want to cry BUT I got a job to do. 

I end up going around the full opposite side of campus and walking along side an insanely busy road on a super steep hill along the frat houses. As I walk down this road, feeling the eyes of the frat boys, looking like a 16 year old, and sweating up a storm... I hit a bump. 

Half the milk fall off my cart and burst, beginning to spill down the hill. I quickly gather them up, saving what I can. And go a little faster to get out of the embarrassment sooner rather than later, which ws a mistake. 

I hit another bump and this time all the milk jugs fall but 2 (one of which was already burst) and all of them burst besides 2. And as I feel the frat boy's and the driver's eyes on me, and the sweat dripping down my arms, and the impending doom of being fired from my first job, and watch the white milk spill down the hot busy sidewalk, all I can think is...

Dont cry over spilt milk. 

I laugh, I vomit a little bit in my mouth, but I don't cry. Then I pick up the damn jugs of milk, shove them on the milk covered cart and wheel it into the art building the cafe was located in. I walk down the hallway, dripping milk the whole way, art students judging me. I pass a janitor who sees my predicament and offers me his rag, as if it would help at all. 

Finally I make it to the cafe and tell my manager he should probably just fire me now. My manager tells me I need to be smarter than the average bear, tells me the short cut for next time, and tells me that everyone messes up sometimes. 

TLDR: Spilled a ton of milk, learned the true meaning of Don't Cry Over Spilled Milk"
7,i saw my dad watching larva the cartoon thing,"usually, you'd find my dad watching action movies, or anything that has fight scenes and guns and all that violent stuff but just earlier today, i found him watching larva."
8,Proudly showed my bare male ass to a really cute girl today,"I have a mild illness that's mostly gone now, but it was really annoying me this morning.  I decided to get a check-up and was asked if I wanted a steroid shot.  I said ""sure!"" and happily went about daydreaming about dumb shit not realizing what was about to happen.

A few minutes later, this super cute girl comes in to admininster the shot.  She had a great ass.  She says something very quiet that sounds like ""it'll be in your bottom"" while she gets stuff ready.  I wasn't fully paying attention cause I was ironically distracted by her ass but then I'm like ""...wait a minute.""

20 or so seconds later she says  ""ok, you ready?""  We pause and make eye-contact for an escruciating second.  I ask ""wait, where again?""  She says ""in your bottom"" very matter-of-factly.  I proceed to comment ""that what's I thought, but I wasn't sure and didn't want to make it awkward when it didn't have to be.""  Ok, it was more like ""oh ok I I thought so but I thought maybe you didn't say that but butt I ok.""  She just say ""it's ok.""

I'm like fuck it, it's gonna happen and she sees this all the time so I unbuckle my pants and drop them down, triumphantly displaying my Golden Globes in their full glory until she's done doing her job and we go about our separate ways.  I noticed the shot was in the very top corner near my hip and I'm like ""did I just moon this girl for no reason?""

Here's the part where I should note that this was at my workplace, and this is a girl I've never spoken to but gets reports from me all the time.  I texted a coworker who trains all the nurses and had this conversation:

Me: ""Lol I'm never coming to [redacted] again.  Just went and had to show my bare ass to one of the nurses lol""

Trainer: ""You went above and beyond, if it was for a shot you only needed to pull down the top corner lol""

Me:""Goddam""

""Fuck""

""I've never received a shot in the butt!""

""She probably thinks I'm an exhibitionist or something""

Trainer: *laughing faces*

Me: ""I'll do a sexy walk next time I see her."" *I proceed to explain who it is*
""If you see her tell her I had no idea wtf I was doing and was not trying to moon her""

Trainer: ""I will lol now do your walk of shame""

Me: ""Hell no I ain't ashamed of nothing, I flaunt what I was born with""

Trainer: ""This is the best *laughing faces* shake what your mama gave ya""

Now if I weren't married I'd probably follow this up the next time I see the nurse with ""well now that you've seen my bare ass, can I take you out sometime?""  My ex-girlfriends and wife all say I've got this perfect bubble butt and would always smack it plus I'm very hygenic, so I just hope she wasn't horrified or disgusted.  Fuck it, I'm gonna tell myself she liked it *pumps fist*.  Now every time I send a damn report she'll remember me as the proud pants dropping butt flasher.

So this whole thing was really not a big deal, but it was briefly a very ""oh shit what am I gonna do?"" situation before I decided to try to own it, and now the trainer and I are gonna have a good story to tell at the next happy hour lol."
9,I'm an idiot,I was at my physics lesson and went home. When I rang the door bell I realised that no one was home and my dumbass forgot the key.. Now I'm standing outside in the cold waiting for my pissed mom to leave work and bring me keys.. Idk how long it's gonna take her and I'm hungry.. Yay
10,Welcome to the neighbourhood,"I just moved into a new flat in a new neighbourhood a week ago. I'm liking it so far. It's roomy and the kitchen is big and it's cheap rent. It's also in a neighbouhood that I've always thought would be agreeable to live in, even though it's a block away from a pretty big, noisy, congested major street. I've been busy this week but have been sneaking out in the late evenings for a cheeky jazz cigarette, to kind of wander aimlessly around the area and get to know it better. Finding shortcuts, landmarks and other idiosyncrasies. 

My favourite part of getting to know a new neighbourhood, though, is meeting the local cats. I live in a cat obsessed and cat friendly city, so people let their cats wander around and are generally trusting. It's pretty great for a cat nutter like myself. I wasn't in my new flat for two days before I met the downstairs neighbour's little tuxedo cat through the window, and just now I met the greatest creature to ever grace the earth: a short, fat, stout, extremely loud and vocal, tailless calico cat. I couldn't read her nametag because when my hand got close to her chest she just rubbed her cheek into the palm of my hand aggressively, while meowing and purring at me. It was all I could ask for in a friendly neighbourhood cat. The best part was that she followed me home and came plumping after me up the stairs to my front door, like a loud, furry little barrel. 

I'm not a particularly optimistic guy, and I tend to be overly cautious about getting my hopes up about anything. But I can't deny that that was a pretty sweet welcome to the neighbourhood, and an awesome way to top off my cheeky jazz cigarette."
11,Weird shrooms experience,"Yesterday, I had a great time tripping on shrooms. I was with two guys I knew but the third guy I didn’t know but he seemed chill. So a few hours go by and and it was a great time really I loved the visuals.... but then two guys walked off and I was alone with the guy I didn’t really know. We were in a park where a lot of people were so I didn’t quite understand what was going through this guys mind because he was rambling.

All the sudden his arm is around me and I didn’t think it was anything crazy, until he pulled out a condom. He was like “we could do it right now.. no one would know” and there are people walking past as he is saying that and then it got kinda forceful and weird. So I had to clearly say no a few times. Then he seemed to be crying (I’m guessing maybe bc the rejection??).

After my friends came back we left since we all should’ve been coming down by that point. This guy is walking behind me talking to himself saying “I wanna die, I wanna die” and I had no clue whether or not to take him seriously.

I found out he is fine but wow I wasn’t expecting all that. I guess we were all at vulnerable states of mind but now I’m not going to trip again for a while."
12,When a stoner meets a drunk in public transport,"I finished work early one Friday and I thought I'd roll a joint and smoke that before heading home. I rolled a fattie and got really baked. After stumbling my way to the metro station, I eventually got on the train, giggling to myself at some stupid meme I remembered. And then I see this guy. He was 6'2 easily and was so red in the face. He was stepping all over his own and other passengers' feet. I knew he was drunk. And I couldn't stop laughing at that. The train started moving and he almost lost balance, despite holding those dangly grip things in each hand. He tried to take his phone out, somewhere during the journey and he dropped his pack of chewing tobacco. As he bent down to pick it up, the train braked so hard, he fell right on his face. Being high myself, it took me a great amount of self-control to not burst out laughing. Then my stop came and I had to get out. Pity I couldn't see the guy all the way till he got off at his stop. Hope he got home safe"
13,I take over people's chromecast when I'm bored,"I work at a University and a lot of the students stream spotify, youtube, netflix, etc. over a chrome cast. These dum dums don't disable the ""let others control your cast media"" feature so I'll mess with them and pause/play what they're casting. 

I know, I know, I'm an asshole. However, I'll also takeover their cast with a google slide and point them to a [link](https://www.techbout.com/stop-others-from-controlling-your-chromecast-device-42326/) that will show them how to disable it. It'll freak them out for a bit, but then hopefully they'll get smarter about what they're broadcasting over a public network."
14,My cat has been asleep on my lap for 6 hours.,"He's gone from a ball, to a loaf, to a flump,  to a sprawl. He's full burrito in a fuzzy blue blanket and, as I'm typing this, shrimp curling his entire head upside down under the covers. I can't get up. I can't even move. I'm cramped. I have to pee. Goddamnit moomoo..."
15,I tried to cut my toenails over the toilet bowl and dropped the nail clipper.,"Ugh. I watched the submerged nail clipper in the bowl for ages. Germaphobe me did not want to fish it out. Broke me didn’t want to spend on another nail clipper for something as stupid as that. Butterfingers me twiddles thumbs sheepishly.

Edit: [Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/W8Zs3pC) are my (finally) clipped nails! Can anyone approximate my height from my foot?"
16,I ate a tomato,"In culinary class Sophomore year of high school we had finished making Bruschetta and our teacher asked if anybody wanted to take some leftover ingredients home. So I took a tomato, and just took a huge bite of it. I don't even like tomatos. I was becoming numb. Ended up finishing it in class, and some dude was like ""you're one of those people?."" No, I'm not. I fucking hate tomatoes, why did I do it? I still have no idea what was going through my mind."
17,Just made kissy noises at a bag of potatoes for the last 5 minutes,It was dark and i thought the bag of potatoes on my kitchen floor was my cat. I was sitting in a chair in the living room and could just barely see it and i wanted my cat to come sit with me. I thought she was just being stubborn.
18,A deer started following me at night,"So I run around my neighborhood every night if I haven't already run during the day. My brother was coming home and saw something following me, so in the car he started to follow me as well to try and see what it is. (We live in mountain lion country so being cautious is definitely good) I didn't know if was him, but he told me there was a deer running after me. I honestly don't know what to take from this. I guess why? Is my main question."
19,My boyfriend is really sweet,"When we went to Walmart the other day, we walked past the hot spot, which had a huge stuffed animal shelf out front. I stopped so I could oogle at a large purple and blue dragon, then we moved on. When he came over last night, he handed me said dragon and my heart melted. The dragon's name is Wendel"
20,Baby poop,"It's 4 AM. My baby just had the noisiest sharts. My wife got up to change the baby. It was a little, and runny. Midway through wiping, my baby poops again. Now it's a lot. This time, it gets on her pajamas. Wife leaves to get new pajamas.  
I start wiping. Baby poops again. I wipe. She poops again. Yellow curry soft-serve, and now the diaper won't close. At least I think she's done."
21,Phantom Jesus poop,"Today for the first time ever I did a phantom Jesus poop. 
For those who don’t know what a phantom poop is it’s when you drop your poop and it disappears into the toilet (more common in deep toilets) therefor disappearing like you never even pooped !
Then with this trick shot I also went for the wipe and checked and there was no poop on the paper ! It’s like I never even went to the toilet ! For I have done my first phantom Jesus poop of my life."
22,I discovered bagels and now I’m an accidental vegetarian.,"I started dieting about a month ago and last week I found that a bagel with veggie spread was the perfect light lunch for me. I’ve been eating mushroom risotto, pierogi, or Thai vegetable curry for dinner and just realized that I haven’t eaten meat in over a week now. I think it’s the longest stretch of meatlessness in my entire memory and it was totally by accident. So yeah uh bagels are pretty awesome."
23,My cat turned my potatoes into peetatoes,"So for awhile my cat had been peeing outside his litter box, in the sink, the shower, the bathtub, the garbage cans, on plates and into bowls, in the closets, everywhere.

Including in my bowl of potatoes. I headed into the kitchen one afternoon to make myself a baked potato, only to find that my precious taters are wet and they smell like piss. Damn cat decided they should be peetatoes! 

I contacted the vet about it and he said to get a sample of it and bring it in for testing. I managed to get a sample on Tuesday and got the results back today. The cat’s got a UTI. He eats special dry food (it costs $70 a fucking bad, Jesus Christ) and he had a shot of antibiotics. I also have to clean all 8 litter boxes every single day because my 7 cats fill them up fast.

Maybe I have too many cats. Or maybe I have too few boxes. I think I will order more boxes and see if that helps too."
24,Bought a new toilet plunger 20 minutes ago.,"Toilet had a clog. Not your everyday ""Todd used too many shit tickets again"" kind of clog. The kind where I seriously considered buying a drain snake (even though I don't think those work with toilets) and pouring drain-o in it (I know you're not supposed to do that) or calling a plumber. 

So I tried with the plunger we've had for a long time. Its a weak plunger. plastic handle sub-par suction cup and a tendency to turn inside out when you apply the right. amount of pressure. It did nothing to clear this mess, so off I left to the store and bought [this bad mother fucker.](https://i.imgur.com/Qm5XMua.jpg)

Cleared the clog in 5 good pumps. When the deed was done I was so happy I said out loud, ""Now that's a God damn plunger!""  
And it is. This plunger has superior suction and the T-grip is fantastic. Go get one.

[Here is the superior toilet wand next to this impuissant and shameful excuse for a plunger. ](https://i.imgur.com/unup6W7.jpg)"
25,All of my social studies/history teachers were guys,"I’ve never had a female social studies or history teacher. I’ve also realized that all of my SS/history teachers were hilarious.

Hm."
26,Short boys...,"I have to be honest, I love short boys. They’re so thicc and they just get my gears a grindin’. Thank you for listening to my ted talk. I love you, short boys."
27,My new CD came in the mail,"I pre-ordered Green Day’s latest album, Father of All Motherfuckers. After 5 months of waiting, it finally came in a neat little package. The back cover is quite amusing and I enjoy the simple, yet chaotic artwork on the front. The songs are 👌 and I’m loving them more and more each listen.

Can’t wait to take another spin with it tomorrow."
28,I forgot Wisconsin existed,"I was listening to the radio this morning. They mentioned Wisconsin and I realized “oh my god, Wisconsin exists”. It’s just such a forgettable state."
29,"Cat time or IPad time, you don’t *really* have a choice","I am goofing around on my iPad and my kitty wants attention. After I’ve ignored him long enough, he’s layed down next to me and is stretching his long arms and big paws over to move shit around on my screen. Guess my priorities have been corrected and I am now giving him the pets he craves.  :3"
30,My shoelace,I was walking down my garden to my shed to get an old mini-fridge and i noticed my shoelace was undone so is stopped to tie it
31,That embarrassing thing you did,"They say nobody is going to remember it, but I remember this one time, when I was 8, I was sitting in Sunday school next to my crush. I looked over at her, and her finger looked FUCKED UP, as if it was badly mangled.  
I asked, ""What's up with your finger?""  
She replied, ""This came from my nose.""  
It was just fleshy-looking snot and blood.  
But I didn't realize it at the time. I thought that something in her nose had chomped down on her finger. It gave me nightmares, thinking that something lived in her nose that had the capacity to disfigure you for life.  
My point isn't that people will remember... because there is no point. I just wanted to tell the story about how my childhood crush scarred me for life."
32,epic gamer moment,"yesterday, i it plat 1 in 2v2 comp, lvl 100 and im boutta get my 200th hour in rocket league YEEEEEEEEEEEEET"
33,I missed my cake day...,By one damn day.
34,I just threw my poop over someone's stall while they were shitting 🤣🤣,"Oh my God what a rush. If you're not familiar I shit in obscure places, urinals sinks etccheck my post history for proof. Someone suggested that I throw my poop over someone's stall while they're pooping and I just did. I wrapped my hand in toilet paper, shit into it and threw it over the stall beside me and I heard a scream and I ran out and I got yelled at by McDonald's employees for running they thought I stole or something. Luckily my house is only a block away from the McDonald's so I got there quickly. i LOVE poop. Psychedelics for enlightenment and a deeper connection to your body and your poop from psychedelics and meditation by pooping in obscure places and being kind to it."
35,My daughter told me about her friends yesterday,"My 16 yr old daughter recently got her permit and is a nervous driver. Due to this she talks NONSTOP while driving. Ok cool except yesterday she was telling me about her friends. I know them all. They seem like good kids. They come from decent families. But, 3 of them aren’t allowed to have bedroom doors. Several of them are drug tested via the OTC pot tests after sleepovers. (Which I find odd without cause) 


But what I found strangest is that apparently she is the only one of her group who is not forced to use a tracking app on her phone. Her boyfriend took her on a date to the high school basketball game (with an 8:30 pm curfew) and his mom called him at the game because he went to the restroom twice during the game. Another time his dad called him because the road was blocked and they had to detour AND THE DAD SAW IT ON HIS PHONE SO THE DAD CALLED TO REMIND HIM TO STAY ON ROUTE. 

Forget helicopter parents. These are DRONES UP YOUR ASS parents.



Edited to add:

My daughter knows that I will look at her phone if I deem it necessary to her health/well being(it’s happened once and only because her first teenage boyfriend shattered her heart then kept texting me to say she was going to hurt herself. I read the texts and so forth. No she wasn’t) but I’m not getting one of those apps. How can I expect her to learn how to make good decisions if she’s never ~~had~~ been allowed to make any decisions and learn from her bad ones?"
36,My housemate accidentally made chlorine gas and our laundry room.,"My housemate works with cars all day and he brought some rags home from the shop to wash and our washing machine. The rags left a really thick residue inside and normal detergent wouldn't get rid of it. We saw online that vinegar can cut through oil so my housemate decided to mix vinegar and bleach in the washing machine to try to clean it up.

While vinegar is good for cutting through stuff and bleach is good for disinfecting, mixing them together can make chlorine gas. Thankfully, no one was hurt and nothing really came of it. If you're mixing bathroom chemicals, double check they're compatibility."
37,had a dream i wasn't sure if i was a girl or guy [nsfw?],"i had a really weird dream last night where i picked up a girl without being 100% on whether or not i had a dick.  and i didn't even look!  i just moved my hips around to see if there was something swinging down there and i was like 'ya, i think so'.  this girl was nice too and even turned an actual guy down so she could leave with me.  i think we were kissing and, more than physically, she was actually into me as a guy.  suddenly i realized i didn't have a dick and was really disappointed.  felt like i'd let her down.  she was like 'are you sure?' and gradually faded into a crowd to reluctantly hook up with an actual guy."
38,I learned about a disorder that makes people think they are cows,"It’s called boanthropy and sufferers are under the illusion that they are cows, and behave and eat like cows. According to Wikipedia, the most famous sufferer of the disorder was Nebuchadnezzar II. He was eventually cured by Avicenna, some philosopher guy.

What a silly thing the human brain is!"
39,Who else has dreams about past retail jobs?,"I worked at Subway for 4 years, and now I work at an office cubicle job for the last 3.5 years. Everytime I have a stress dream about work, it’s always about Subway. 
I dream that I came back and have to open the store and can’t remember how everything works, or I came back and they reorganized the whole store and I can’t find anything. I never dream about my office job, about submitting a report late or entering in some wrong figures. 
It’s weird, because I didn’t hate working at Subway- it was a pretty chill experience compared to other people being slammed at McDonalds or Wendy’s or whatever, and I had a good boss. But anytime I have a stress dream, I’m back at Subway."
40,I got banned from working the night before April Fools,"I have no idea where I could share this story but here seems like a good place! So, I got banned from working the night before April Fool's Day at my job. This was my old tech job at a big box store. We had a manager who was really into team building and asked me to pull a prank on the team the night before April Fool's Day. 

For our friends who don't know what that is, it's a day where we pull pranks and jokes on each other. Kind of a national holiday here.

So, I am closing the department that night which means I will have an hour to set something up to prank the techs coming in the next day. I wanted to make sure I did a few so that way, the morning crew and the mid day crew might have a chance to enjoy one of these pranks. I make a list of a couple of things and spend the hour setting up the different things between helping customers, then leave for the night.

I came back into work the next day to half the department glaring at me and the other laughing. Uh-oh. 

I didn't even have a chance to ask how they felt about the pranks. I heard it all day and once they kept going realized I *may* have gone a little too far. 

Here is what I did:

1. I put a piece of tape over the laser for the mouse so it wouldn't move. Once they figured that out, they found my next prank.
2. I rotated the screen. It's a quick key to fix though so that was just a ""oh, ha!"" Moment for them. But then I continued.
3. Screenshot of the desktop, set as desktop, then hide icons, and hide the start menu. This made it look like you were clicking on things BUT it was just an image. Once they figured THAT out, they hit the next.
4. I created a script that when you click the mouse, the disc drive opens. Every. Single. Time. They quickly found the script text file (on the desktop) and deleted it. 

So, that was a good set of pranks, right? Oh, that was only 10 minutes worth of my hour long prank marathon. 

We had an area where all of our computers being stress tested (running a 12 hour video). We had around 12 laptops at that time. I set all of them to full volume, all playing nyancat, the 10 hour version on YouTube. So when they had to take them out of sleep, they would blast that song. Imagine.... 12 times of hearing Nyancat blasted at you at around 6am. 

Then, to escape it you head to the back area that is separated from the main floor by these dividers. But, what's this? Why can't you get through? 

It might be because you had a coworker package tape them together. And when you finally fight your way past those dividers, there it is. Another laptop. Stress testing. And you KNOW it's going to scream NYAN at you.

But it doesn't. And you sigh in relief. Once to find out your coworker put a screamer video on it that had 8 seconds of silence in front of it so right as you think you were safe, you were *wrong*. 

But surely... SURELY the torture is over, right? 

No, you fools. I had another twenty minutes to kill and I just had coffee. 

After all... how could I forget my dear Manager? 

There is a photo of him that he shared to us as a Joke. It was Christmas when he was 8 and in an adorable snowman costume. He hates this picture. Loathes it. So... what does he find in our department? 

It. Is. EVERYWHERE.

It is the desktop background to all the work computers in our department. It was hung up in the back room. And did you know, there's a program that can analyze a photo and splits up the printer spool so you can print a small image, really, really big? He found out. As he walked into the back room to see a monstrous 5 by 8ft picture of himself in roughly 30 pictures put together. 

Once he tore them all down and went to threw it away, what do his eyes see? But his own face. I had taped one copy on the underside of the trash lid so as he tossed away papers, it flipped up to greet him. 

But surely, you say desperately, this MUST be the end! 

You fool.

You absolute fool. 

I had access to the helium tank that night as we had an event the night before. I blew up three balloons, tied to a string, and tied them in the back. But... what's this? There's something INSIDE the balloons! 

It's childhood snowman sir. And he's on a slip knot so the moment you try to release it, the ties spring loose and now they are floating to the 25ft ceiling to live for the next week until they slowly lose their life in the gas war.

But this... this is finally near the end. Once I had done all of that, (including leaving stupid dad jokes on post it notes around the department to find) I only had 1 more up my sleeve. 

So after I had been taken into a room and asked, why. WHY would I do ALL of that? I said, I am sorry. I thought it was be funny. 

My manager didn't look me in the eye the rest of the day. I almost got away when I forgot my last joke. As I heard my manager curse my name once more. 

I had put 1 last photo under the cash till so when he pulled the draw to count the money for the day, he was once more greeted with his snowman face. 

The store made it mandatory to close with at least 2 people per department after that and I was banned from working the night before April Fools."
41,"In 9th grade, I gave a presentation on the song “sleep now in the fire” by rage against the machine","We were paired off into groups of 2 to make these presentations.  First we would play the song or music video for the class, and then we would explain to them the meaning behind the song.  My partner didn’t care which song we chose, so I got to choose the song.  I knew that I wanted to do a rage against the machine song, but it took me a while to choose which one.  I eventually settled on sleep now in the fire because it was one of my favorites, and I felt that I could easily explain the message.  

Ironically, my partner and I both forgot to even mention what was meant by “sleep now in the fire.”  You know, the name of the song.  The phrase that’s repeated 100 times in the song.  Yeah, we forgot to mention it.  Our teacher asked us to explain what “sleep now in the fire,” meant, and we panicked.  We couldn’t think of an explanation on the spot like that.  I’m pretty sure we got a good grace anyways though.

Now, whenever I listen to rage against the machine, I think about how I would’ve written that 9th grade presentation if we had done it on whatever specific song I’m listening to."
42,Why I don't like 12 year olds,"The other day at work I told a kid he couldn't get free water, I turned around to walk away and they threw a coin at my head and it got me directly in the temple (side of the forehead) and it made me super dizzy so they’ve got quite the throwing arm lmao

I turned around obviously looking more pissed than I thought, they got one look, pointed at their friend, and ran.

Little shits"
43,"We were driving cross country a few years ago and I insisted we drove through Alabama because I HAD TO see Greenbow,Alabama where Forrest grew up.","Yeah, it doesn't really exist.
I should have googled first. I was so so sad."
44,My family recently adopted a miniature daschund and he was definitely the happiness everyone needed,"We got little Neil around a month ago and I’ve never seen my mum and her partner so happy. My mum has even made him a twitter account and she recently got so many likes she is super invested. 

It’s nice seeing them finally happy. I wasn’t sure how it was going to work as we were definitely a cat family (4 cats before my parents split up) but now my mum is definitely a dog lover. 

Not sure if allowed but [this ](twitter.com/SausageNeil) is Neil."
45,Tuesday,"I’ve had an interesting day.  I wasn’t expecting it. The most I was expecting was taco Tuesday at a close locally owned Mexican/TexMex restaurant. 

I thought I was going alone, but an old friend called me to join her and her daughter, her daughter’s boyfriend and her daughter’s best friend at the place I had planned on eating alone but I enjoyed the idea. 

We ate. It was delicious as usual. The young man that I hadn’t previously met, my friend’s daughter, Bailey’s boyfriend, Nick grabbed me by the hand and gave me the best handshake I’ve ever had. It was strong, well placed, I instantly liked him. 

Bailey’s best friend was turning 21 and had no plans. I listened to her over the lunch and got the impression that she didn’t feel the idea of a birthday was important. This kind of hurt me. 

I bought lunch then directed Layla, the friend, to the liquor store. I bought all of the drinks that she mentioned as we were eating. 

We set up the house after we sent the kids to the store for some mixer and a set of cards. Made it open, many places to sit and chat and started in on all of the mutual connections. People responded quickly and well. We said we’d provide the liquor if they’d stop by and bring a notional gift, something personal. Like a card. 

People started showing up. Dawn, baileys mother was a wonderful hostess. Many people showed up, lots stayed. 

My favorite holiday is other people’s birthday. Layla got cards and homemade soap, perfume, make up accessories. She told me she was so glad that we all met at lunch because she would have just stayed home and cried. 

Happy birthday if it’s your birthday."
46,I bought tickets on TicketSmarter not TicketMaster,I didn’t realize. Now I know. I could have saved almost $100
47,"Every time I have to make phone calls the next afternoon, I end up having to make several","Last night I already knew I had to call the chiropractor behind my house to see if I could make an appointment without a referral today. After I decided I needed to make that call, I realized I also had to call my insurance to see what they would cover from the appointments if I chose to go. Then right before I went to bed, I got a letter telling me an unpaid bill that my old insurance was supposed to pay is about to go to collections, so I also had to make that phone call. Four days ago I had to call my dentist to ask questions, then I had to make a phone call to my insurance to check if I could even still see my current dentist (PPO babey) and I was able to set up an appointment. I hate phone calls."
48,I can only cum while laying down,"Title. I can't cum when my Dick's horizontal, only when it's pointing up. No idea why."
49,I just fell asleep in the middle of an exam,"Title. I just finished the exam, and there was still half an hour until the teacher collected the sheets. So, I just laid my head and took a nap.

When I woke up the teacher mocked me."
50,I like my car,"I just bought my first car, an old Nissan. Runs quite well despite the age because the previous owner didn't use it much. I'm expected to use it to drive my little sister around in addition to whatever I use it for.

Dad: ""Well now you've gotta name her. If you develope an emotional connection you'll automatically drive her more carefully""

Me: ""It's a him actually""

Dad: ""Oh?""

Me: ""I'm calling him the Big Brother""

Dad: ""Aww that's coo-""

Me: ""Cuz he's my... Nii-san"" *finger guns*

Cue awkward silence the rest of the way home.

I don't know if my dad is proud I'm following in his footsteps or disappointed he didn't make it first.

Maybe a combination of the 2.

My sister refuses to call the car his proper name. Rude."
51,I hate subtitles,"They're really distracting and they become all I see rather than anything else on the screen. Everyone I know uses them religiously, no matter the volume. There are so many shows and movies where I only have a vague idea of what actually happened beyond what was said."
52,Saw my first crackhead yesterday,"I was going to the greek house i pledged to and this guy (who I first thought was a house member because it was at a distance) shouts ""FUCK YOU BITCHES"" then walks over to me at which I realize he's a fuckin crackhead and says ""hey, do I have time to talk to a beautiful lady"" i'm saying nothing, trying to guess how quickly i can sprint to the house, the only defense i have is a rape whistle but then he says ""okay, talk to you later"" jumps onto a ledge and starts waving his arms around while screaming and running around the campus.

So cut to today, I go back to the house for a party and I see the silhouette of a person, I reach for my whistle but it's just my friend carrying a box of pizza.

So that was an experience."
53,gross thing fell from a tree,"i was out with our family dog for a walk and she started pulling to sniff a brownish spot in the snow on someone's lawn.  she was really interested and i didn't see any harm in giving her a minute to sniff so i let her.  there were a couple of these brownish spots in the snow and i assumed they were poo stains left behind from someone who had picked up after their dog.  dogs are pretty gross so of course that kind of thing would be interesting to my pup.  

after a couple of minutes i started pulling my dog to keep walking but she was still super interested.  suddenly i heard a 'thud'.  we were standing under a tree and something had just fallen from above.  about ten feet away was the mangled, bloody, flattened body of a chipmunk.  this was, of course, completely unexpected and a little disturbing.  took me a minute to realize a bird must have dropped it.  

i looked into the tree thinking i'd get to see a bird of prey, but it was only a crow up there.  my guess is that the chipmunk was roadkill the crow had scavenged.  also, these brownish spots now made sense: they were the bloody marks left in the snow from the crow dropping its dinner a few times."
54,I tried putting this on a Mandela effect sub but it wouldn't load.,"I swear I remember that live action cat in the hat with mike Meyers came out in like 2017,18,19 or something but I googled it and it came out in 2003?!??
I remember telling my little brother about it and how stupid it looked but 2003 my brother didn't even exist! And I know I didn't tell my older brother cause we never talked about movies back then. I was 2 years old when it came out but I remember seeing the trailers for it and how creepy the fish was.  I remember my mom saying ""wanna watch the new cat in the hat movie"" and she put it on the tv on the wall, in 2003 there wasn't a tv on the wall it was a huge box tv on the floor.  I really swear it wasn't released in 2003, at least in my mind, I asked my brother and he remembers it as 2017 too. It's really killing my head."
55,"Back in the day, I used to sneak my buddy into my room late at night to smoke weed and hang out with me","Dave lived right next door to me.  We’ve been friends for our whole lives.  We both grew up to be stoners.  Back in the day, I used to sneak him into my room late at night while everyone was asleep, and then we would smoke weed together, whisper, and watch TV with the volume so low that you needed subtitles.  We had to be quiet because we didn’t want to wake anybody up.  We’d hang out a lot during the day too.  This was just something that we did for a few years.

Sometimes we’d just want a quick smoke before bed, so we’d smoke weed through my window while Dave was in his driveway.  Sometimes we’d trade money for weed through that window.  It always made me feel like an asshole for sneaking around like this, but I miss those days.  Those were the days when I mainly smoked at night out of fear that my parents would notice that I was high.

One time, Dave got too high and ended up puking in my room.  He cleaned it up.  I didn’t even have to ask.  Another time, my older brother came home late, and he wanted to talk to me about something.  As soon as he put his hand on the door knob, Dave calmly and quietly stood up, walked somewhere out of site, and hid.  My brother didn’t notice him, but he did make a comment about how my room smelled good (we had just smoked, and my older brother is also a stoner).  Then, there was this other time when I heard Dave’s older brother talking to my mom about how he thought that Dave was sneaking his friends into their house late at night because he could hear their door open.  I thought it was funny how Dave’s older brother got it backwards.  Dave was sneaking out.  He didn’t sneak anybody in."
56,"Today I walked 10,801 steps so far.",And holy fuck am I exhausted lol.
57,I finally drove with the windows down and music playing and it was amazing!,"I love listening to music in the car, and I love driving with the windows down, but social anxiety has kept me from doing both at the same time.  I am always worried people will stare or think my music is lame or I'm weird or something.  But today, I decided screw it, who cares what a bunch of strangers think of me?  It's a beautiful day outside and I want to feel the breeze as I groove to my tunes. 

So here's my advice: anything you love doing or have always wanted to do that you know isn't a big deal, but you just can't bring yourself to because you're worried or scared?  Try it again on a beautiful day like today."
58,I missed my cake day!,"Like yeah, I didn't realize it was my cake day 4 days ago. I was just caught up with so many things to do and didn't even notice. And I missed it."
59,I miss “my” Nissan,"I worked for a summer camp this summer that rented brand new SUVs for us to drive the kids around in. (It was an expensive summer camp.) On my days off I could drive my SUV into town. It was the nicest car I’ve ever driven, and driving through the mountains was fun.  The SUV had all kinds of bells and whistles including lights that turned on automatically. 
Now I live in a small city with an incomprehensible road structure and I just bought a pre owned sedan whose lights don’t turn on automatically. I was driving home at night and trying to figure out why I was getting honked at. When I realized it I was so embarrassed that wanted to cry. My worst fear is that I’ll do something boneheaded on the road and someone I know will see me."
60,I got a bat hat,"I went to a store in a mall where they embroider a design on a piece of clothing, like a hat, jacket, headband, or backpack. 

They only had one bat design and I chose it to be in blue on a black hat. It’s pretty nice (but low key looks better on the back). 

Rip $21"
61,A police officer came to my house today.,"He had the police notebook with the names and emergency contact info of local residents. He told me he had just transferred to the local police station and was doing a neighborhood patrol to check if everyone’s information was updated and give reports on recent crime.

Turns out, there have been attempted break ins in my area, which is somewhat suburban / rural. He also said there have been some *successful* break ins near the city center where the thieves broke the locks to gain access to people’s home and steal valuables. 

He warned me to make sure I lock all the doors and windows at night and report any suspicious people or behavior.

Honestly, it was surprising since we live in a very quiet neighborhood, a small town, and one of the safest countries in the world. (I know there would still be crime, of course, but didn’t expect there to be a wave near me.) I know some of my friends don’t even lock their doors, which shocked me when I first came here. (I’m in Japan.)

Still, tonight I’ll be dead-bolting the front door. I’m grateful the local policeman came by to check on us and keep us updated though. 

(When I heard the information, I also thought “How surprised should I look? How long should I look surprised? What if I don’t look surprised enough? What if I look too surprised!? Will he think it was me!?”)"
62,I ate salad with a spoon today.,"I was bringing salad and soup into my room so I can watch my shows and eat. Unfortunately I had forgotten to bring a fork up with my salad bowl, so I just opted to use my soup spoon to eat the salad with. It was a little finicky, but I managed to get the job done.

Also, it resulted in one less dish to wash, so I had that going for me."
63,Idealizing people subconsciously,"You see someone on social media, and it becomes very easy to create your own narrative about them. Maybe this is weird but sometimes I find it refreshing when I meet up with someone or run into someone I may have been idealizing and realize their life isn’t all what they make it seem. Or maybe the aren’t the person they make themselves seem to be. r/instagramreality has been so helpful for that. It makes me realize that I don’t have to live up to people expectations and I don’t owe them something if there’s absolutely no way for me to know about it. Being genuinely kind should be enough to judge my character. Social media is really problematic."
64,I saw people repairing shopping carts at Wal-Mart today.,"I didn't know, given the state of their shopping carts, that anyone ever worked on them. But the other day I was rolling one and realized it had four perfect wheels. And today I saw them with power drills and hammers in the parking lot banging away on some carts! 

I guess there is good in the world after all."
65,Homeless man I gave money to yesterday paid for my coffee this morning,"Yesterday there was a very obviously homeless man playing guitar on the corner, and I passed him on my way to work. I gave him $5 in change and asked him how his day had been going etc. This morning I went into the coffee shop right beside where he was yesterday and he was in front of me in line. I said hello to him and was using my phone after that, not paying attention. I went to pay for my coffee and the barista told me that he left some of his change to cover my order!! It was honestly the most heartwarming thing that has ever happened to me!! I hope that old man feels really good about doing that because it made my entire week"

67,My Cracked Screen Protector Melted Back Together in the Hot Sun,"I've had the same screen protector on my phone for about a year, and over this period of time it's adopted a couple cracks that go almost all the way across the phone. They used to be sharp and have a significant split between them, but it wasn't bad enough for me to bother replacing the protector yet (and it had only been a month since it started cracking).

I went on vacation in a much hotter and sunnier climate than where I live and after leaving my phone in the sun for over an hour, the screen protector melted slightly and fused the cracks back together making it smoother when I slide my finger across the cracks.

I thought it was kinda cool."
68,I decided to make a new Reddit account,"I've had my first one for a few years now, and I just felt like it was time to start fresh. Half of the communities I joined, I hadn't looked at in years. A lot of the comments and posts were about things I'm not interested in anymore, written by someone I don't even recognize. It's weird, this completely fabricated weight we put on ourselves. This ultimately unimportant account was becoming such a burden to me for no particular reason, and it had me itching for a change.

I think so much has changed about my life in the last few years that maintaining that account just feels wrong. It's not even like I had a lot to look through - and ironically enough commenting/posting more is something I'd like to do with this account - but I'm weirdly relieved. I know I can always find them if I look hard enough, and that's comforting enough. Maybe weird, meaningless, symbolic changes like this are just ways of checking in with yourself about where you are in life, and it's best not to question them too much."
69,I was making a milkshake and it wouldn’t come out of the blender and I was so confused and then I was like oh yeah it needs milk in it,
70,I think I lost my lucky coin,"Ok, it's not a *lucky* coin. It's more of a utility coin, but I feel rather attached to it.

So, I'm playing Pokemon Omega Ruby on my Nintendo 3DS, and if you have played it you may know that if you're trying to hatch a lot of eggs, it's much more easier to do it on the Battle Resort, because you can just hold down the UP direction in the d-pad and you'll move indefinitely (in Pokemon, you have to walk a lot to make eggs hatch, rather than waiting some amount of time). 

So I had this coin that fit perfectly under the d-pad, so I used it to do the trick so I could focus on something else, and I used this very same coin for some years now.

And I just noticed I have no idea where I put the coin. My main suspicion is that it fell somewhere in the sofa or in my bed because I was playing my 3ds there, but I didn't have much success finding it so far.

Well now I'm kinda sad :/"
71,"My wife’s co-worker requested a week-long vacation to return to China (her home country). When she got to the airport and realized all the flights were cancelled, she called my wife to ask to come back to work instead.","I don’t really know what the point of this story is, but I guess it was...ironic so here goes.

My wife works in a hospital as a section chief in a department with direct contact with patients. One of her subordinates asked for a week-long vacation to visit China, her home country. The hospital couldn’t technically refuse her request, but strongly advised against it. The hospital looked up the city she was traveling to to see if there were any outbreaks, and there were. (I don’t remember the name, but it wasn’t Wuhan.)

The employee told my wife she was going anyway. The purpose of her trip was “refresh”. So vacation. It had actually been requested *before* the virus was discovered, but the woman wouldn’t change her plans despite knowing the current situation.

My wife’s job involves organizing shifts for the workers. She contacted the other department staff to cover the woman’s shifts and patients and fixed the schedule.

Corona virus news gets worse and the hospital suggests she not return to China. This person doesn’t listen.

Her week-long vacation starts and she goes to the airport...only to discover all flights to China are cancelled.

She calls my wife on the hospital line (not cell line) and asks to come back to work for the week instead of taking the vacation as planned. My wife tells her to just relax at home or take a domestic trip and that she can’t suddenly call all the employees and ask them to rearrange their schedules and patients again on such short notice. But the woman insists she wants to return to work the next day because she is now “bored”. 

Request is refused.

74,How I became accidentally racist by grabbing some chocolate,"This happened 2 days ago but I still cringe a bit at it. I went to my local corner shop to grab some sweets because I have no self control and grabbed a bag of chocolate. They're a bag of Galaxy Minstrels  [and in this day and age I'm amazed that they keep minstrel in the name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Minstrels)   [I mean, come on. They may as well begin with an 'N' have 2 'G's' sat in the middle and an 'R' to top it off.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minstrel_show) 

So I grab these unfortunately named chocolates and head to the till where there's two people at the front. They're black. And I'm stood there with this bag of fucking Minstrels in my hand wondering what the fuck even is my life anymore. 

I never knew a bag of chocolate could make me feel so damn awkward. Usually they just make me feel like a fat bitch."
75,I further complicated an already complicated situation,"My first year in public school was my freshman year. The first person I made friends with was a girl named... let’s call her Hannah. She and I bonded over Harry Potter, and we started talking like 14 year olds tend to do. I realized I liked her... a lot. 

I was a shy 14 year old who didn’t understand relationships and thus didn’t do anything about my feelings. Two months later, she started dating this guy named Jack. 

Hannah and Jack dated for three years, during which I found my first girlfriend.

About a year after they started dating, I remember that Hannah and Jack fooled around as teens are want to do, and Jack wasn’t the best at reciprocating, so, after asking me for advice, Hannah told Jack that she no longer felt comfortable with what they were doing. 

My first girlfriend left me for a (significantly) older man and it *fucked me up*. 

I was depressed, I was suicidal. One night, summer after junior year, I sat in my floor with a knife in my hand, ready to end everything. I was looking for a reason, any reason not to, and sent out texts to a dozen of “friends”. Hannah was the only one who answered, and by being there for me that night, I believe she saved my life. 

Hannah and Jack broke up in the fall of senior year, a mutual breakup— they had simply drifted apart. I, at the time, had a friends with benefit that Hermione knew about... I told her most everything. 

Christmas of senior year, Hannah starts getting really flirty. We ended up going on a date at the movies. New Year’s Eve she tells me that the date went great but... she and jack dated for so long she just isn’t ready. And I know she’s telling the truth and that’s fair. 

She gets accepted to the best college in our state, and I get rejected. That led to a downward spiral in my life that caused me to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in scholarships to other schools. Hannah was there for me through it. 

After we graduated, hannah went to school two hours away  and I started dating another girl named Brea. Brea and I dated for five months and it was... amazing. But brea was going through some shit at college and I was taking time off, just working through my shit, and our schedules didn’t line up well. Brea fell into a depression, and, at my encouragement, sought counseling. Her therapist told her that she needed time to focus on herself, and thus she broke up with me. It fucked me up for a long time— not as much as my first girlfriend had but... still. Hannah was there for me then. 

I hit up a girl from middle school who turned out to be engaged... but I let her cheat on her fiancé with me. Hannah was by my side through that one too. 

Over the summer I was talking to another girl who was just kinda trashy altogether. She was ghosting me at the time and Hannah and I were hanging out. I was sad and she was hugging me, and Hannah ended up finally biting the bullet and kissed me. For five years we had both always wandered and.. it was amazing. But Hannah didn’t want to mess up what we had. We were hanging out a week later and we ended up making out inside her car. 

Then she went back to school and things went back to the way they had been before. She got really busy and we barely talked. 

Two weeks ago I visited her in her college town, and after hanging out she kissed me on the cheek in a way that didn’t feel too friendly. 

Last night I went to visit her again... and we ended up doing more. We made out, and progressed even more. She ended up topless. I stayed the night and when we woke up, I played with her clit. And then afterwards, she cried. 

She told me she was scared of our relationship changing forever. She’s also a practicing Catholic, which a healthy amount of that good old catholic guilt. She told me today that she feels like shit after that, and that it can’t happen again. No kissing or anything. And I obviously don’t want her to feel like shit, I’m sad that I fucked up a good thing. 

I love this woman. And sometimes it’s confusing... I can’t always tell if it’s romantic or if it’s platonic love. But I think deep down I’ve always had this idea that we’d end up together. 

I’ve just somehow pushed us forward two steps and then back four. It’s just confusing... and I feel like I may have fucked something up forever and I just... it’s depressing."
76,Always thought my penis was below average size until today,"TLDR, I measured it incorrectly many years ago and forgot about it until recently.

&#x200B;

So somewhere in my late teens or around age 20 I started dating my wife and I became insecure about my penis size as she was the first person I had sex with, so I measured it a couple times and always got somewhere between 5.3 and 5.5 (the global average). 

&#x200B;

A couple days ago I was having a conversation with some friends and one of the women began talking about the correlation between mens' personalities and their dick size. I always found conversations like these to be fairly callous and they always left me feeling insecure. 

&#x200B;

However it did get me thinking about size again, so I looked up how to take a scientifically accurate measurement and realized I had done it wrong many years ago. Apparently, you have to press the beginning of the ruler directly into your pubic bone and then measure over the top of the shaft to the head. I did so and measured 7.0 exactly. I thought this was incorrect and kept trying for a solid 10 minutes. I'm not sure I believe it still so I'll try again in a few days. 

&#x200B;

I did tell my wife about it and she didn't care, as expected.


Edit: retook the measurement today and it was slightly higher. Will post update in couple days with a margin of error"
77,I am saving the small unusable part of soap bars to make a whole new bar,
78,Accidently (flirted?) With the cashier at Wal-Mart.,"I was buying an entertainment center and had an L cart, but somewhere along the way of b dry of bringing the L cart to the self checkout area I brushed against a wall of fake flowers, and I thought I put all of them back but when I got to the self check out machine I still had this one flower, so I turned to the cashier lady, I guess manager?, and caught her off guard while she was turned around. I asked if if she would like them and she turned around to a single flower, and she accepted it in a sarcastic way so I apologized as I didn't mean to come onto her or anything but she told me it was cute and it was alright.

Tldr:flowers fell onto cart and I gave them to the manager"
79,I went from driving a 27 year old truck to a brand new car and it's surreal,"I've never owned a new car before, only old shitboxes on the verge of death. I've been working on my own cars since I started driving, partly because I enjoy it but mostly because my other option was walking. I normally buy a cheap car that doesn't run, then slowly work it into shape over the course of several weekends and several hundred dollars until something eventually breaks that isn't worth fixing.

Most recently this was a [93 Chevy S10](https://imgur.com/a/5biaGU6). It has no airbags, cruise control, ABS, traction control, cupholders, fuel gauge, or 3rd synchro. Current leaks include oil, brake, door, exhaust, and coolant. It emits many mysterious noises and odors and gets passed by logging trucks going up hill. Despite all this, I love it. I've kept it running against all odds, and I've adapted to its limitations.

Now that I'm starting to build my career, I can't keep that up; if something breaks, there's no guarantee I'll have a free weekend to fix it. I needed a car that would will start every day, so I bought a 2020 Honda Civic. 

I am completely amazed by it. 30 years of technological progress is a lot to take in. It's eerily quiet and smooth, everything is digital and precise, and the interior is comfortable. I can control all the windows and mirrors with buttons, highways aren't terrifying, and it even has a thing that keeps you in your lane if you aren't paying attention. I mean I've driven cars with most of these things before, but now I have them all the time. I feel like I did when I got my first smart phone. It's all so exciting and convenient and flashy. 

I barely know what to do with myself now. I'm so used to the noises my truck makes, listening for new ones and trying to figure out what's causing them while I drive. In the new car there are no noises, but I listen closely out of habit. Nothing is broken or worn out. There's nothing I need to make time to replace, no parts to find on craigslist, and no weird questions to ask on a forum. It's my car, but it doesn't feel like my car."
80,My teacher had a crude sense of humor,"This was a language class where my professor gave us a few minutes every class to write in our journals. After this, she would ""randomly"" select 5 people to bring up their journals so she could critique our writing. My professor even made it sound reasonable as she informed us that a student would not be able to bring up their journals more than once every 4 classes and I was content with this system. That was until one day my teacher called me up the one time I happened to have an erection. In a desperate attempt to quickly get rid of my problem I flexed my body trying to get the blood flowing somewhere else, literally anywhere else. My professor called my name 

""Now please,"" she demanded with a fake smile as if she knew I had a boner. 

Instantly, I thought back to post I saw on 9gag where an instructor had admitted to looking around the class and calling up students who had boners just for amusement. Was my professor that same fucked up person that made the post? Surely not. Then she asked, 

""Don't be shy, come on up."" 

""Yeah, shes that fucked up bitch.""

 If that's how she was going to play then I'll play too, so I got up with my poorly written journal and anxiety-filled boner to begin the longest walk of my life. After walking past a couple of table groups, I finally approached my professor.

""Nervous to show me your work?"" 

""Fuck you too,"" I thought to myself.

I got back to my table group and straight-up asked my friends,

""Why do I always get called up when I have a boner?""

A few guys in the group, as well as guys in other groups, agreed that they noticed the pattern of having erections when getting called up. After class ended everyone was up trying to leave so I took this opportunity to walk to where my professor stands to call people up for their journals. I looked at my seat and got down to the same eye level as her, where I could see under my desk and above the chair, where my boner would be.

Just to confirm that my professor uses 9gag, a student was trying to summarize the majority of the 9gag community, which she replied with enough information that she uses it as well.

I'm sure you can see the points I'm trying to connect and I just think it's too much of a coincidence for it not to be true. Anyways, thanks for reading my pointless story."
81,This happened today and finally made me feel old for the first time in my life...,"So, I'm at the bowling alley for an event and 2 lanes to our left was a group of 4 college age kids, over 21 as they were drinking. They were boisterous and cutesy so I noticed them.

As I was leaving, I noticed that they were trying to take a group photo by leaning the phone on one of your chairs and were struggling. Upon seeing this I kindly offered to take the photo for them. The girl who was fiddling with the phone accepted and thanked me.

They were all standing in front of the lanes so it was a great backdrop. I took a few waist up shots and then zoomed in and took a few closer ones. They thanked me again and I went to join my group. 

As I turned to go, I glanced in their direction and see the same girl attempting to position the phone on the chair again to retake the photo using the self timer....

I felt so. very. old. 

Plus...I'm utterly confused as to what was wrong with the photo I took. Sigh. Sadness. Farewell youth. I do not welcome you oldness."
82,the worst thing that happened to me today,"i was grocery shopping today at the shitty grocery store because they have things the good grocery store doesn't carry.  i never buy produce there but thought i'd take a look.  they had a deal on limes, four for three dollars and i thought that was reasonable so i grabbed some.  everything else looked like crap so i waited until i was at the good store to get the rest of my produce.  when i saw that the limes at the good grocery store were on sale twelve for four dollars i actually said out loud *'oh, come on!'*  i felt like going back to return my limes to the shit store but i'm pretty sure they wouldn't let me so all i could do was buy more limes.  this basically ruined my day though."
83,I was looking at the barista's hands...,"While he was filling the cup at the machine, some of the hot coffee sloshed onto his hands. He didn't seem to flinch, so I looked closer onto his hands. I don't know why I did that, maybe I was expecting to see old scald injuries and ""deduce"" that he's used to burns in his profession.

But then I observed something more - he was polydactyl. I quickly averted my gaze. God, I hope he didn't catch me leering."
84,"Y'all, the internet has some great resources","I've been doing a decent amount of research for a story lately, and I've had to look up a decent amount of miscellaneous stuff. I've never really had to do this kind of research before, so every time I look up some weird specific thing about space or planes or something and a solution just comes right up I'm shocked. 

&#x200B;

I had to figure out what the inside of a nebula looks like. It took literally two google searches to find a solid artist's rendition based off of an article that some dude had written in a magazine. I had to figure out what the cockpit of a propeller plane looks like so that I could base a space ship off of it. The first youtube link was from a guy taking his Cessna 172 out for a spin from a regional airport airport ten minutes away from me. I had no idea there was even an airport so close! That explains the constant Cessnas flying over me. I had to see how a space suit was folded  for storage. The first link was a Quora post with one answer from a guy who worked at NASA with a diagram. At least, Quora said he worked at NASA. I have no idea how they validate that. 

&#x200B;

Just, shit, this is awesome. I've only ever researched things for school projects before, and that's always a huge pain. I never realized research could actually be fun."
85,My life is turning into a Stephen King novel.,"**[CONTAINS MISERY SPOILERS]**

I finished reading *Misery* by Stephen King about a week ago. 2 days after finishing, I completely tore my left achilles playing soccer. In the book, the main character has debilitating leg injuries and eventually gets his left foot cut off in a gruesome scene. Having just read the book, I couldn't get over the irony of the situation.

 To make things even crazier, when I went to get surgery  on Tuesday to reattach my tendon, my nurse looked *very* familiar. She was the spitting image of Annie Wilkes. Tall, husky, black bob haircut. I nearly had a panic attack. I couldn't believe it. She asked why my heart rate was so high and I confessed. She thought it was hilarious. And teased my as the prepped me. When they started to put me under for the surgery, she leaned over me and said ""you dirty-birdy"" before I passed out. It's hilarious in retrospect but I was freaking out while going under."
86,So what had happened was..,"Last night or the night before, I'm not entirely sure, it was pretty late and my boyfriend and I were sitting in bed, with our electronic devices and snacks; basically just being bums. I've been consumed with my art, and online shopping, He's been playing his ""simulators."" I call them games, because that's what they are in my opinion. I try to explain to him that when he decides to go out, get a job, and buy his own devices, so he's not hogging mine, then he's welcome to call them whatever it is he feels like without my jokes. 

When I say game, I mean, he downloaded a flight ""simulator,"" where he tilts my phone from side to side, and just flies around with no real purpose. But yet he insists, ""Babe, It's not an effing game, It's a flight simulator. These are the exact controls used in real planes. They use this same program to train pilots. And pilots don't play games."" Insert my not uncommon eye roll. So I replied with, ""But real pilots know how to actually fly planes. You are not in school to learn how to fly planes. You're not in school or work for that matter. You are a pretend virtual pilot, and you don't know how to fly a plane."" He's always so quick to get defensive at this point, and believe me we have this debate more than once a day, so I'm technically just giving him a hard time for shits and giggles. Insomnia had been kicking my ass lately, and my mental health hasn't been in the best shape, so I tend to push his buttons a little bit more than I should. He's a pisces. Overly sensitive at times. He will go on to huff and puff about how if he had real plane, he would be able to get in it and fly it no problem because he's been practicing long enough on the ""simulator"" to know how to fly just like an actual pilot."" This is the third time this week he's made this outlandish statement. ""You've been playing this game for two months now and still at least more than once a day you get distracted by something irrelevant, and forget your flying. I'm just amazed you still get so shocked when the game starts blaring at you as your plane blow up into pieces. If you were a real pilot you would have died."" 

It's safe to say that once again, we found ourselves sitting on opposite sides of the bed, not speaking to one another because he's a child and I don't negotiate with terrorists. Oh! it wasn't last night, this was the night before last; but anyhow I was still being petty with the need to get just one more victory under my belt for the night, so all I could come up with was to break the silence in the best way I know how. Side note, whenever we're up in the wee hours of the morning, and everyone is sleeping, he absolutely hates when you startle him with any kind of super loud, out-of-the-blew declaration of noise. If I'm being honest I could have probably come up with something better, but chose to blurt out in this annoying, teenager girl in highschool meets rejected broadway performer, voice that he hates with a passion,

88,Wedding thank you cards.,"Let me preface this by saying I'm not a heavy drinker. I drink a few times a year.


Although, since getting married it's a slightly more but still not a ton.


Anyway I have this 'I'm getting Meowied' glass my mom got me before I got married. (It was on my registry). And I just feel like it should be filled with champagne for wedding activities. Addressing the wedding invitations with my mom? Champagne? Check! 
Stuffing envelopes with my then fiance? Champagne? Check! You get the idea.


So finishing addressing our thank you cards should be no different. Except I'm home alone and they have to go out tomorrow to hit that three month mark. 

Fuck it, I'm drinking champagne by myself tonight. I YouTubed how to open the bottle and everything.


All is going well until I lose the stamps! Under the cards? Nope! Under the envelopes? Nope! With the heavy duty I weigh a lot stamps? Nope!
Surely they are lost within my list of addresses? Nope!


... They were on me. They fell on me at some point in time. It was a rollercoaster of emotions.


I'm almost done. Just took a break to post this."
89,I became a honorary member of a religion,I was leaving high school and these 70 year old men and women gideons were handing out free bibles. I’m not religious but me and my friend decided to take some. They didn’t mind. I was walking to the metro with my friend and one of the gideons was walking by and he said “do you want to give any of those books back?” And I said we are planning on giving these to our friends and family. The Gideon then said to us “god bless your souls. You are a honorary Gideon member.” Then I went home.
90,Unconsciously flirted with customer at my new job,"Some context. I haven't been employed in three years cause disability. This has all been pretty crazy... Circumstances decided that I had no contact with the opposite gender during that time. Or anyone else for that matter. In my defense haha. 

Just a peculiar experience for me is all. A girl came in that was about my age and exactly my type. I work retail so she was coming across the floor in front of me. I couldn't help but stare at her but I was too shy to say hi. She was a shorter blonde girl, pudgy cheeks, cute smile. So she said hello instead, and I said hi back. Few minutes later she comes to the register and we joke around a bit. She made a joke and I guess I was so distracted I didn't hear her so I didn't respond. She made a remark about being quirky and awkward then apologized. I rebuttal almost unconsciously and said I thought she was really funny in an obviously affectionate way. At that point I realized that definitely sounded bad, hah. During the next few seconds I had a really hard time not looking at her breasts, because, you know, *wow!* :I Fortunately my self-control game is strong. She wasn't uncomfortable or anything, and we both said goodbye in good spirits. 

So I feel kind of like I did something wrong but like I said it wasn't a conscious thing. I genuinely couldn't control that. Losing my first job in years because of debauchery would be bad. Should probably keep a lid on those feelings. I also thought I was gay for a long time. Ya... Unlikely!

93,Just left my number on a receipt.,"I’m over 30, haven’t dated in 12 years, and a good friend dared me $3 to put my number and “you’re cute, call me” on our dinner receipt. I never do this and I did it anyway.

Waitress was cute, asked probing questions, and provided more information than I’d normally expect.

She probably was working her tip up conversationally and earned it but I still feel like I’m in my early 20s over this whole silly thing."
94,I saw raccoons on my way home today.,"Today was a really busy today so I was walking home ~3 1/2 hours later than normal (throw off those stalkers, kids). I was walking my normal way when I saw a raccoon scurry around the corner. I followed it (I knew my friend would enjoy pictures of a raccoon) and I saw a pair of raccoons foraging under a tree. They were just chilling, doing their thing, a little upset I was watching them. I moved a little farther away to give them so space and they started chittering at each other, kinda fighting, kinda still foraging. Eventually we both went on our ways. 

They were cuties."
95,Biscuits with Extra Butter,"You know the cheddar bay biscuits, right? The ones from Red Lobster? My husband had bought a box of them the other day and we were on the hunt for a midnight snack.  


We open the box. Biscuit mix, and...two garlic seasoning pouches?  


""Huh, we can use it on something else later, if you want. Wanna save it?"" The idiot. The absolute goddamn fool.

""No,"" I clutch the two packets close to my chest. No one can take this moment from me. ""We're gonna make it all.""  


His eyebrows go up, his mouth open as he tries to force the ludicrous words from his throat. ""That's a lot of butter...""

My face feels tight, I realize now that my face has been contorted into a grinch-esque smile for ages now.  I know. I've always known. I was born knowing. 

I move quickly to the stove and start melting two sticks of butter. Husband is set to mixing the biscuit dough. I'm careful to only let it simmer--I can't ruin this with burnt butter. I know it's only supposed to be brushed onto the top, but I can't help this. Not when such a blessing has fallen into my lap. Was it a factory worker asleep at the button? Was I blessed, chosen? It didn't matter. The biscuits were in my kitchen now.

My husband pulls out a cookie sheet. The complete buffoon. I take the dough from him and spoon the biscuits into our cast iron pan. These bastards are getting toasted by the perfected seasoning of this black, beautiful cookware or I'll die baking.  


The 20 minutes in the oven was a lifetime. My husband was instantly sucked into his phone while I labored over the perfect butter. The herbs and seasoning swirling around as I stir, perfectly marrying the golden liquid I so desperately craved.   


Then, the moment came. I pulled them out of the oven. My perfect, perfect doughchildren had become robust biscuits. As I baptized them in the cherished garlic butter, I knew that I would never again accomplish something so bold, perfect, and awe-inspiring in my lifetime. I savored the moment almost as much as I savored the biscuits.  


Then, came the real indulgence. We had an entire stick's worth of melted, seasoned butter on reserve for this moment. I took that hot biscuit and gave it a healthy dip into the hot bowl of garlic glory. The butter danced around the crumbly outside, barely cutting through to the fluffy insides.  I was an absolute animal with butter dripping down my chin, crumbs flying everywhere as I bit into this buttery, crumbly example of the pinnacle of human achievement. The salty, garlicky, buttery bread crumble cured all my hatred and loathing for the world, if just for a moment. I looked upon the face of God, which also had crumbs and butter at the edges of its smiling lips, and knew that my place in Heaven was secured. This was my calling, my holy right, approved by God. This was my blessed miracle.

Only moments later I return from my flight of olfactory and palate joy to my husband enjoying a biscuit himself. ""Wow, good job. These are even better with the extra butter.""

110,Things the twilight zone made me think of,"At the end of ""the monsters are due on maple street"" Rod Serling said ""
The tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout.
There are weapons that are simply thoughts, attitudes, prejudices, to be found only in the minds of men. For the record, prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless, frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all of its own for the children and the children yet unborn. And the pity of it is that these things cannot be confined to the twilight zone.""

And it kinda made me think about how people act, like I've seen so many people get so caught up in the drama of maybe someone got into some scandal, and they're so quick to hate and scream at whoever it is without even knowing what actually happened. Idk what it was with James Charles, I wasn't really listening to that, but I saw so many people in like TikTok and instagram and Reddit everywhere, hating on him, he lost so many subscribers and then they found out he was innocent. Suddenly he's loved again. Why do people change their minds so fast?? And I do this too.  I don't even realize it but when I look back at what I've done, who I've agreed with, it's usually the popular opinion.  And that YouTuber who everyone said was cheating I forgot his name, turns out he's not cheating and same story, back and forth like a metronome . It's so scary to think that one misunderstanding can cause thousands upon thousands of people to run and hate you.  If I were famous and If something like that happened to me, say someone accused me of something then everyone who previously loved me suddenly wanted me denounced and hated. Once the misunderstanding was cleared up and all the fans came back, I would never trust them again. How could I?   Now that was just media influences that got it. What about politicians? I'm very stupid when it comes to politics but I know it's probably been getting heated. There probably won't be a war but all it takes is one misunderstanding. One mistake one insult gone too far and it could be over.   Idk"
111,Successfully had small talk,"At school, there is this huge door that a lot of students go through. Today, the wind slammed the door shut right before I went through and because it was slammed so hard, I couldn't open it. I pulled about three to four times and because I knew there was someone behind me and I didn't want them laugh at me silently, I turned and said ""Help."" (By the way, I said this quite desperately.) She got closer but right then I pulled the door open so it was a-okay.

Then, we walked side by side and we made small talk, talking about which year we go to and what our courses are. I learned that she studies office & retail to get a job as caretaker for children.

((When I asked her which year, she said fourth and I went ""Whoa, I thought you were a fifth or sixth year."" And when I told her I was a sixth year, she said ""Haha, I thought you were a fourth year.""))

And then we ended the two minute-long conversation because I had to go the other way and it was really nice and yeah.

I posted this because I'm quite awkward at regular conversations so I'm awful with small talk and I thought it was too pointless to tell anyone but I wanted people to know about my achievement."
112,Business card,"When I was about five years old. Me and my grandma went to this gardening store to get plants and seeds. I mainly just went there because I thought it was cool. Anyway we are walking around and I saw this table with things for people who were there. The table had likes cookies on it and their business card. I didn’t know that this table was for anyone was a customer. So I grabbed a business card. I thought I was stealing it and I have no idea why I would even want to do that, but then again why would they have 100 of them. Anyway I went home and immediately felt guilty. I couldn’t tell my mom that I’d done this. I hid the card under my bed so that my mom would not find it. Maybe a year later I told my mom what I’ve done, not thinking very much of it just a pointless story now. She told me that it was just a business card and that you were supposed to take them. I was dumbfounded. Now I look back on this is a funny story but it’s kind of pointless and no one really cares to hear it."
113,My family got another kitten and our two cats are finally getting along," We have had this cat for over a year, and she seemed lonely sometimes, and my mom and i wanted a kitten so we just kind of got one. Our first cat is very timid and more like a dog than a cat sometimes. Basically, she is weird and we thought it would take forever for them to get along. 

When the kitten first got here, she hissed at her every time she saw her for about two days. I’d wake up to growling and this kitten would be doing the arch^tm 

Yesterday though, the big cat was four feet away from the little one all day. At dinner they were chasing each other around and playing with each other! 

It’s weird, as they seem like polar opposites personality wise. One is shy and quiet, the other is veeery loud and outgoing. 

I’m just glad they won’t be hissing at each other for three weeks."
114,I seriously can’t tell if you’ve lost weight,"I can’t tell you how many times people tell me, I’ve lost 10 pounds! I’ve lost 20 pounds! Can’t you tell??? 

I absolutely never can. If I see you often, you always look the same to me. 

However, I’ve been starting to low key try to lose some weight by trying intermediate fasting and snacking on veggies, but nothing too serious, so I’m not expecting results yet. But like two people have told me already that I look slimmer.....?? I see no difference.  And I didn’t tell them I’ve been trying anything, either. 

I feel like I have a type of body dysmorphia where I can’t see changes in body lol, not even my own."
115,My sister is getting married and she asked me to be maid of honor!,"I'm so happy, I knew she finally found the right guy. And growing up we weren't really close, we fought a lot and really hated each other for a while. But since becoming adults we've grown closer, and it makes me so happy that she wants me to be MOH. I'm kinda nervous though lol, I have no idea what a MOH does, so I guess I'll have to do some research. Wish me luck 😅"
116,Kate Spade sent me an email about Apple Watch bands.,"I shop there often, so my local Kate Spade will sometimes email me about new deals. They just sent me an email regarding their new Apple Watch bands saying I was looking at them last time I was there. I don’t own an Apple Watch so I found this sort of silly."
117,I met the cat who lives upstairs today,"I've lived in my building for about two months now, and I kind of guessed the person upstairs had a cat, but I wasn't sure until today. I came home and he was just hanging out the the entry way (it's only a six unit building). I got to pet him and he really likes me. His name is Ricky and he tried to sneak into my room.

I guess his owner likes to just let him wander around sometimes?"
118,I think I looked like a crazy person in Starbucks today.,"I went to Starbucks today, which is quite rare for me. But they had a new seasonal drink, which I am just a sucker for. 

But I told myself that if I go there, I’ll finish preparing my lesson plan for an English lesson (ESL) that I have in two days. 

Keeping my promise to myself, I sat down with my drink and began writing the draft for my lesson.

I’m going to be teaching “this”, “that”, “these”, “those” to kids. To do so, I’ll be placing different numbers of objects around the room, and also giving the kids cards with the words on them so they can place the cards in the right places. I also use other cards like a “?” card to prompt asking a question. 

When I prepare my lesson plans, I often practice the lesson to see how it would work. Helps me find any flaws it might have, such as things that might be difficult for me to do or things that could be confusing for the kids.

So I’m in Starbucks, pretending to place invisible objects, pointing to invisible objects both near me (on the table) and far from me on an invisible whiteboard, hold up invisible cards, flip over invisible cards, clapping (silently) for the kids, making confused faces to prompt “what’s this?”, smiling to praise good work, 

I’m sure the other people here think I must be some crazy lady."
119,My 14 year old nanny kid just ran through the house screaming her head off.,"She screamed so loud my ears are ringing and I now I have a migraine and my ears hurt. 

There was a stink bug in her sisters hair."
120,I can't remember names for the life of me.,"I was going about my hometown today as I had paperwork to drop off at the courthouse, so I decided to stop by a local cafe for a late lunch. The woman who served my table was someone I recognized from high school, but I couldn't remember her name. The worst part was that she knew *my* name, but I didn't know hers.

I went to a small high school, so most of everybody was acquainted with everybody else. Most of the people in my school knew who I was, even if they had never spoken with me, and vice-versa. But here I am, the one who can't remember anybody's name, going around my hometown constantly being recognized and never being able to reciprocate that level of recognition. I feel selfish for my inability to put names to faces. 


My plan is to go back tomorrow for lunch and see if her name pops up on the receipt for my meal."
121,did laundry,"bought tide pods for the first time because they were on sale at shoppers drug mart. 4.99! got the cold water ones because there's something spiritual about washing your clothes on the cold water setting rather than the warm/cold cycle or the hot/cold cycle. i do not know what i mean by this

when I swapped my clothes from the washer to the dryer, I noticed some weird clear sticky stuff on a couple of socks and some underwear. the pod hadn't fully dissolved during the wash cycle, the bastard. 

I went back to my room and grabbed my bedsheets, which didn't really need to be rewashed but uh, like hell I was going to rinse the pod remnants out by hand. so I spent 1.75 to get the goo out, basically. and then another 2$ for a separate load of clothes in the laundry

I spent 9 dollars on laundry"
122,Work drama,"Everyone I work with apparently hates eachother. 

I have my direct co workers (not so much about them), and many many people I'll work with maybe once or twice a year. This guy hates that guy hates this chick hates so and so's parents, it's just a web of hate. 

(Of course I'm sure some hate me but I don't hear about it.)

I keep myself entertained trying to keep up with it. 

Currently one guy has been very vocal about hating another guy. Then needs the other guys help and, surprise surprise, other guy is ignoring him. 

Another lady has been talking shit about someone who left months ago, even though they always seemed to be friends. 

Fun times. Also, everyone mentioned is well over 50 years old, drama never ends."
123,I found out I’m not permanently banned from my favorite game,"So back in September, I was obsessed with this game, Horse Isle 3. It’s aimed towards kids, but it’s a horse game, so naturally I’m gonna be there. I had been told I was permanently banned after I sent some choice words to another player because they took a joke I made about communism way too seriously and it really pissed me off because they were calling me uneducated, meanwhile everyone else understood that it was a joke.

Well, yesterday I issued an apology to the entire support team of the game and they responded that I was banned for at least a year and that I could contact them again in September 2020 to have my account restored.

So here I was, thinking I’d never play that game again, and now I’m told I’m only banned for a year. I must say, I’m quite relieved, that game is awesome."
124,"a bug bit my forehead, kinda itchy kinda hurts",it's red. it hurts. it's itchy. what's worse is that it's next to the only pimple i have. how is life going for you?
125,I'm actually doing pretty well in medical school,"I came from a shitty public school system to a good university and now to a good medical school. I'm surprisingly doing well, passed my STEP 1 with a great score."
126,one of the guitar strings of my guitar snapped as i was playing the guitar,"i'm still learning how to play the guitar and as i was trying to learn how to play perfect by ed sheeran because apparently, it's easy, the 3rd string snapped. it had sharp ends and all that so now i have a medium sized scratch. yay."
127,I really miss my girlfriend (we haven't broken up),"I moved home recently and then there was a  problem that caused the house to have no electricity.  So I've had to stay with my parents until it is sorted out. I haven't properly seen my girlfriend in a while.

We went from practically living together like a married couple to now only seeing each other every few days, which is not normal for us. She used to be over almost every day.

I feel lonely doing basic things like cooking a meal or going to bed, because we used to do everything together. Once everything is sorted out, I can't wait to be with her again."
128,"Tinder: a wild, uncivilized kingdom","Disclaimer: for some reason I like regaling in a lengthy manner. Tldr at the bottom. 


If you've been single for any length of time within the last decade it's reasonable to assume you have used tinder or something similar.

If you have dated, IRL or online you probably have your share of horror stories. 

My story involves someone I never actually met and sent maybe 10 messages to. 

Let's begin: 

I'm swiping away and I match with a pretty attractive girl. She was T-Mobile girl pretty so I'm going to refer to her as T. 

T and I exchange a few messages. I'm really trying to spool up the ol conversation-mobile but she is just really boring/unwilling to engage. 

I say fuck it, even though I'd walk all the way to the US, marry an elderly woman for citizenship and switch phone providers just to bump into T-mobile girl at a gas station, it's time to unmatched her. 

Done. Our digital connection has been severed. 


Fast forward about a month and a half

I'm out with another buddy, painting the town red. Just having a good old fashioned hootenanny.

We've worked up an appetite and the establishment we were at happened to have a restaurant side.

We pop on over, treating ourselves to their finest baskets of chicken fingers accompanied by seasoned fries. 

Buddy is way more intoxicated than I am and he's wasting no time decimating his meal. 

I'm about 2 bites into my first chicken finger when I hear a commotion going on somewhere in the not too distant distance. 

I look over my shoulder and there's an agitated woman causing a ruckus. She's looking towards me. 

I look around thinking there's someone else she fixated on. 

There's not. 

It's me. 

I'm the target of her tirade. 

I place my chicken finger in the basket and wait. 

As she approaches she's saying things like: 

""You're and asshole"" 

""How could you"" 

""Fuck you"" 

I'm still not even comprehending what's going on and my friend literally couldn't care less. He has fries to finish.

The rest of the restaurant does care. They are pretty much mute, soaking this all in. 

I ask what's up 

She says ""you unmatched me on tinder!"" 

I actually burst out laughing. Such a trivial thing and this chick wants to King Charlse me. 

I say I'm sorry and turn back to my feast. 

Before I can make another move she snatches my chicken basket right off the table. 

Although I valiantly attempted to save them from from abduction I failed. I must have looked like Joey defending his meatball sub. 

They were in her control. 

She just slamdunked them onto the floor. I may not have ordered wings but that chicken took flight. 

Literally everyone gasped. 

At this point her friend standing behind (who I hadn't even  noticed until this point) mumbles some parseltongue to her and the scurry away. 

I look over and my friend us finally looking up from his meal just grinning like a prick. 

Well, I need more food, so I approach the bar order more and buddy says they're on the house. 

Solid dude. 

I got my chicken fingers and resumed my shenanigans. 

As I'm eating it clicked. It was T. 

Tl;dr: ghosted a girl on tinder before meeting her, she randomly ran into me, Homer Jones'd my chicken fingies and I got a free replacement."
129,I had one of the most soothing moments of my life.,"I was (just now) playing Red Dead Redemption 2 online, just roaming around and hunting for pelts; while listening to Africa by Toto, on repeat. 

It was one of the most relaxing and enjoyable moments I’ve had in a really long time. 

.. and I just got back from Rome. 

Highly recommend (both).

Edit: spelling."
130,I accidentally snorted vitamin C,I was smelling the tube it’s in cause it smells really good and turns out the tube was almost empty and the little bits of powder at the bottom had gone to the top and it went up my nose. I don’t think I’ll ever be the same
131,My grocery store budget was $75 and my total at the register came out to exactly $75.00 without me rallying up the total as I shopped.,
132,Ice cream,"Today my mom bought my favorite ice cream, I’ve been asking her to buy it for a long time.I’m happy."
133,today one of my students threw away his mechanical pencil after it ran out of led,"I asked him why he didn't just replace the led, and he said pencils are married to their led and so replacing the led is infidelity. i then asked him if he thinks its ok for people to remarry after they're widowed, and he said yes but people are different than pencils."
134,didn't use conditioner,my hair looked greasy and limp this morning and i think it's from my conditioner.  i use a mild shampoo so i didn't condition it today.  i let it air dry and now it looks like a bird's nest and i actually prefer it this way.
135,Haunted coins,I swear they weren’t arranged on my desk before
136,Bluetooth headphones and porn...,So i was watching some porn with my Bluetooth headphones on and my phone disconnected my headphones to play some lovely porn on my sister's speakers... I can't leave the room im so embarassed.
137,My SO bought me chicken nuggets as comfort food while I was sick,"I put one in my mouth and bit hard on something. I panicked, and fished out a decently sized bone fragment. I don’t think I’m interested in chicken nuggets anymore."
138,Going to the bar,I’m going to the bar right now
139,Cracking eggs is hard,"Not today blah blah blah about 3.1415926535 89793238462643383279 days ago. 

Cooking breakfast as per my morning routine. 

3 eggs need to be cracked and conquered.  

First egg: perfect amount of force, precise angle, counter edge contact was astounding. Seamless separation and *ploop* egg successfully landed in the bowl and the shell is simply discarded into the sink. 

Second egg: a little too eager. A bit too much force. Like when you hit the counter with the egg and some of the fluid splooshes onto the counter. Whatever. I'm a pro. I continue on and *ploop* egg 2 has joined egg 1, the shell also thrown into the sink. 

Third egg: slightly larger than the rest, potentially laid by baby yoda. It fucks with me. I'm resilient I can do this. I've learned from egg 2 to be a little more gentle. I whap it off the counter. Perfect. I lift the egg into the air and *ploop* egg 3 is in the sink right where it belongs and the shell is simply tossed into the bowl with eggs 1 and 2.....

......

.......

...........

Wait. That's not right. 

I'm not too worried about it though because I'm a laid back guy. 


Tl;dr; 2 eggs 1 bowl, 1 egg 1 sink."
140,my cat is scared of literally everything,"I move my hand, she twitches, I sneeze, she runs away then come back, I think she's also scared of herself sometimes, she is so cute but sometimes I'm sad because I don't know how to make her understand that no one can hurt her when I'm there"
141,So nervous I erotically posed for my doctor,"So, where do I begin? 

Edit: Male 


I was at work and I had to take a poop. I scurry off to the bathroom and take care of business. Things aren't going smoothly for me at all at this point. I'm finding that I have to exert more effort than normally required and it feels like I'm shitting out pinecones. 

Before I wipe down the hull and get out of dodge I decide to admire my handiwork. To my surprise the toilet water is bright red. I'm instantly freaked out. 

Now I start wiping. It's just blood and I'm not ok with this. 

I hike up my trousers and just walk out of work. See a boss on the way out and tell him I have to go to the doctor's office. 

I get there and describe my situation to the doctor. 

This is where I make my mistake. I don't know if it was the nerves or what but I still can't figure out why I did what I did. 

So, we're in the examination room and the doctor asks me to drop my pants and lay on the table. 

What do I do? 

I take my pants off (I am naked from the waist down) and bend over the table, ass towards him, presenting myself like some whore and crank my head back to look at him. He's perplexed. 

He says ""no, on your side."" 

So I maintain my standing position and now I'm just bent to the side with one arm resting on the table. Feeling more exposed now. 

Again this is not what he wants.

He must have realized I was not picking up what he was laying down because he walked over, caressed me like a child and laid me on the bed. 

I just fully doggied out for a doctor and then had another adult position me on a bed because I lack the aptitude to follow basic instructions. 

I'm laying on the bed now, fetal position facing away from him. 

This is what he wanted. 

He does his inspection says it was just an anal fissure (just a cut from a hard poop) and there is nothing to worry about. 

I'm relieved but now feel like a donkey for overreacting. 

I'm good to go. 

On my way out I feel blood running down my legs again so I pop back into the bathroom to check out my situation and it was not blood. 

It was just excess lube running down my leg from the inspection. Now I feel gross and dumb. 

Props to all my ladies and men that have to deal with fluids running out of there body after sexy time. Not a comfortable feeling. 


Tl;dr: I pooped blood, went doggy for a doctor and leaked lube down my leg."
142,My dog has gunk in his eyes sometimes,Yeah so my dog sometimes gets gunk in his left eye. I don't know where it comes from but the vet says it's fine as long as I wipe it off regularly. It's gross to wipe the gunk out but hey if I helps my dog I'm fine with it.
143,My mum came to visit,"My parents live 4 hours away. I haven't seen her since August. In the almost 2 years I've been living in my current house, my mum hasn't seen it. 

It's just a normal Thursday at work and I'm serving through the ocean of people wanting their food. I look up to serve the next customer and my mum is staring straight at me with the biggest grin on her face. 

It was a complete surprise and it made my whole week. I was so excited and none of my coworkers understood what all the fuss was about."
144,The battery in my kitchen scale has lasted a very long time,"So I was in the kitchen at work and I noticed there's now a weighing scale and it has a knob on it. I turned the knob and it made a whirriing noise and turned on. The action of turning the knob generates the electricity to power the scale and I thought ""Oh, that's clever, saves batteries"" and then I thought about my kitchen scale, the battery has lasted at least 15 years and it was second hand, so it could be a good bit older. And then I thought, that knob is ""moving parts"" and became very skeptical about something like that lasting more than 15 years. It's a surface that may get liquid spilled on it and turning it requires a lot more force than a knob on a cooker. Then i became slightly smug about the idea of this more environmentally friendly solution actually being counterproductive. Then I thought ""that's not really the attitude to have these days"" This is a good idea, but this isn't the best application for it, you want to put it in something that can't run off a single battery for 15 years. Although there's probably a happy medium, how often would you have to crank the handle on your phone to keep it running?"
145,I wish I listened to my friend,"I recently went out of state for the first ever to go to a convention with my friends. I only took a small carry-on suitcase and a backpack because I didn't think I needed too much, it's only for a week. 



Well the thing is I ended up buying more clothes because I wasn't used to the cold weather of the area ): 


I also bought way more souvenirs than I thought. And then I while I was buying some plushies my friend asked me if I really had enough space in my luggage for all the stuff I was taking back home, and I was like yeah I should have space, I didn't really think too hard on it though I just assumed I did.


Predictably when the time came to go home I couldn't fit everything inside my luggage. 

I solved the problem by mailing  the rest of my stuff home but I really wish I didn't have to because of how much shipping costed me... and even then my luggage and backpack were still pretty full 

I didn't tell my friend what happened because I just know he will rub it in and tell me I told you so lol I'll just pay more attention in the future"
146,Gf hasn’t seen Star Wars. Started watching them together and she tried to give me head during order 66. Honestly considered taking a break,
147,"I've got into a weird habit of starting a bunch of my sentences with either ""bro"" or ""yo"".","I'm a girl (not that it matters imo) but lately that's all I can say. I don't know what's up, it just feels right and slides right off my tongue. I need to stop though."
148,IM PROUD OF MYSELF,"After years of silently suffering, not knowing if i was just a defective person, shaming myself for being unable to do things, isolating myself for months and months, I finally went to see a doctor. I finally got diagnosed with severe major depressive disorder. I knew it was bad, but hearing it still shocks me. My doctor told me with a tinge of sadness in his voice, that I should have reached out for help years ago. I finally am on medication. I’m struggling with getting adjusted to it, but this is my first REAL step towards recovery. I went to the cat cafe to celebrate :-)

Edit: oh WOW. i am blown away by all of your responses. thank you for all your love ❤️"
149,The mirror has a warped section about 1-foot wide,"One of the walls in the bathroom is a mirror. About a 1-ft wide section of it is weirdly warped so anyone who stands directly in that section seems slightly thinner than usual. 

Every morning I get out of the shower and am momentarily shocked, almost stunned in confusion and disbelief, thinking to myself how insanely impossible it is that the workouts have been so quickly effective! Then I step a bit to the left towards the door and am back to normal."
150,Toothbrush robots,So my STEM class had a thingie after school for anybody to come to make little toothbrush robots. I made a green one and a blue one and named them lil greenie and smol blue respectively
151,"When I was in 4th grade, I auditioned for my school talent show by singing Holiday by Green Day. Acapella. I didn’t even make the bill.",
152,At the unemployment office,"Sitting in one of the chairs at the unemployment office along the wall under inspiring posters, all the chairs are full, everyone has their phone out, reading. I bet I’m the only one reading about chaos magic though."
153,It’s interesting that Wars have background music.,"In the American Revolution there were pipers & drummers, in Germany there was a lot of brass & trumpets, French Revolution there was drummers, A lot of the common ones had trumpets and bugles.

It’s just interesting to think about, that in the mist of all the shooting, there is someone who has to entertain & command their people through music and instruments. It’s like it’s own kind of genre."
154,Chance happenings,"I was on my way to a study room in the uni library when all of a sudden I decided I wanted coffee instead. Turned around, walked out the library. Then en route to the coffee place, I saw a person I wanted to avoid, so I took an alternate path. Then I encountered an old high school friend and we decided we should go drinking together sometime soon."
155,My parrot laid an egg today,
156,Today my farts smell like pumpkins,
157,My mom let me walk to the store today,"I usually walk to my sister’s school so my mom can pick us both up there (plus she gets out half an hour later so it works) but today I had $14.75 so I called my mom and asked if I could walk to the market and then home, and she said yes!

It was a 40 minute walk, versus the 25 minutes I thought it was, and it took me an hour get there and another half to get home, because I had my backpack and I had just done PE, but it was fun the whole time. 

In the first part, I was walking on the opposite side of a street to a kid going home. She was the only one heading in that direction. It’s up a hill, so kids who live there (including me) usually ride their bikes, drive their car, or have their parents drive them. I thought it was odd.

In the next part, a lady walking her dog crossed in front of me to go to the other side of the street. Her dog was black and it kept staring at me. She said “Hi, there!” I don’t think she would’ve said that to an adult. I like being a kid. I should’ve paused my music, I think I might’ve talked over her.

Speaking of dogs, I passed by two gentle giants while I was going up the first hill. They were barking but I talked to them a bit and one tried to bring his ball to me. They were on the other side of the fence, though. I didn’t see them on the way back.

A bit later, an older couple turned onto the street behind me, probably going to the same market I was. I was really close by now. I switched to the trail (there’s a trail next to the sidewalk separated by a small fence but they pretty much go the same way) so they could pass me. I looked down and I saw horseshoe prints in the trail. I took a photo. It was pretty cool.

I got to the market and I spent a long time deliberating on what to get. I started with sour gummy worms, chocolate covered pretzels, and Oreos, and gradually switched out products until I had lucky charms, Betty crocker’s brownie mix, a heath bar and a candy bar that was parent sized. I say parent sized because my parents say they only ever want a little and the little they take was roughy the size of the candy bar.

My total came to $12.89. The guy at the register asked me if I wanted to use the change (75c) or the dollar. I said the dollar was fine, but I didn’t really understand what he meant. I was thinking about it and I think he was trying to say he’d just take the 3 quarters instead of the full 89c. Oh, well.

I ate dry lucky charms on the way back. I swear they used to have less marshmallows. Not a whole lot less, just a bit. I glanced to my right at one point and saw the front of a car in the bushes. I took a photo. Not the whole front half, just a bit of the metal. It scared my mom when I told her, but the short fence started up again soon after, so I wasn’t really in any danger of getting hit.

I also saw two dead mice almost the second I walked out of the parking lot. I thought they were alive for a second and they really freaked me out. I almost jumped right into the street. I took a photo of that, too.

Towards the end, my feet and my back were hurting, but not my legs, even as I walked up the hill, which I was really proud of. There was a guy going all the way up the hill on his bike. He was barely faster than me. I don’t blame him at all, I would’ve gotten off to walk the rest of the way by then.

When I got home, I tried to give my mom the parent sized candy bar, only to find it was bacon flavored. I gave it to my sister instead and told her to dare someone at school to eat it. She gave me a bag of limon chips. I should’ve gotten Lay’s at the store instead of lucky charms. They had them, and it was a dollar less.

I gave my dad the heath bar and I made the brownies. They tasted more like cake than brownies, but this time they weren’t burnt and they came off clean. I’m going to get frosting next time. They work better as cake. I got home right before dark. It’s 9 right now. I should probably do homework but I’m going to tell my mom I don’t have any and just play Skyrim. Tomorrow I’m going to get up early, go for a walk, and do my homework then. I haven’t gone for a morning walk in a while and I kind of miss it.

I might walk to the market again tomorrow. Or I might go to my sister’s school but stop at the stand and get popcorn or sour balls or strawberries. I might save my lunch money and wait for Girl Scout cookie season on Sunday and buy some girls scout cookies. I think I’ll do the last two, actually.

158,The Grocery Store Vigilante,"I'm going about my work in the bakery department, and this old man comes up to the counter. I assume he wants answeres that I don't have for his question, but he starts unloading stuff from his basket onto the counter. I think for a second that he's an associate, dropping off damaged goods, a very normal occurrence. But he's not dressed in our uniform, and the stuff he's giving me isn't from the bakery. He dropped off a pack of matchstick cut carrots, a bag of celery, and an empty box that I think once held plants. He said he found them where they don't belong, in the freezer. I said, ""Uh, thanks, but in the future, you should take these to the service desk up front."" To this, he responds, ""I found them in the freezer.""
Like, ok, thanks, you wacky old man, very thoughtful, but these are *produce*. *I* work in the bakery, on the exact opposite side of the store. I have nothing to do with vegetables, none of my department is even *close* to being that healthy.

Besides that, why would you give me *an empty box*? What could you possibly think I need this for? I'm just going to throw it out, why wouldn't you just cut the middle man and do that yourself?

People baffle me, I swear.

By the way, I eventually threw out the carrots and celery with the other damaged goods. Later, I joked they were in the freezer because someone saw the ice cream and gave up their New Year's resolution."
159,My crush threw a pencil case at me,"So.... She usually gets mad at me for getting the usual extremely high scores I get and I got a perfect score in a practice EOC (End of course test)  so she was extremely mad at me and threw a pencil case at me... Several times. One time I catched the pencil case mid-air and did the motion of ""threatening"" to throw it back, by pure reflex. Again I didn't even think of doing it, it was an automatic action my body took. I started kinda profusely apologizing to her. She was mad at me for the rest of the day. (I forgot to note that she is aware that I like her and she said she likes me back)"
160,Saw the SpaceX Starlink Satelites last night. I was impressed and not sure what I saw at first but after a little google search I quickly found out what it was.," Even my husband was impressed, he's usually dead inside so that was surprising"
161,I've been talking to un-hatched ducklings as if they are in my womb.,"You know how you hear of pregnant moms and dads talking to the bebeh's before they're out of the ute so that the bebeh's are more familiar and comfortable with the post ute-world? Yeah, that's what I meant. Sorry if the title is misleading. 

I hope when they are born they recognise me as their master and follow me around the garden in a neat little line behind me. I'll wear a duck costume if I have to."
162,didn't get heartburn,"i made pollo mexicano a few nights ago and i've been eating leftovers since then.  the night i made it i got crazy heartburn because of all the onion, jalapeno and garlic in the recipe.  oddly enough, the last couple of days it hasn't given me heartburn.  i guess it mellowed in the fridge or something?  even if it's becoming milder and still delicious, i'm getting kind of sick of the leftovers so i'll be glad to eat the last of it tomorrow."
163,I'm missing out by not doing drugs,"I don't feel like dealing with emails, people, or thinking right now. Sometimes I wonder if I'm missing out by not doing drugs. I imagine that that's the reason most people start doing drugs....to escape reality or their own mind.

My mind is constantly darting back and forth with no rest or an off switch. Even my dreams are fcking exhausting....

I'm not sure how people cope with this. I'm not creative and I'm pretty lazy so I'm never so busy I get distracted. 

My brain is tired.

Pointless story over."
164,311 Was an Inside Job,"I bought a coffee today that cost 1.89. I gave the barista a five spot. She said ""3.11 coming back!"" And I replied ""I didn't know that"" thinking of the band. I was halfway to class when I realized my error."
165,The opossum I’ve been feeding nibbled my thumb by accident tonight and it was the most adorable thing ever!!!!,"He was right outside my door eating, and I was like, “Omg! I have some wet dog food left from Calypso (RIP) and I bet he’d like some!!!!” I carefully opened the door and slid the can out. His face was RIGHT THERE and he smelled the food. He went to take a bite and the bite moved, and he just seemed so surprised. I practically heard him say, “OPE! Sorry!!!” He *barely* bit me. There wasn’t even an indent on the skin. The second he realized it was a thumb he went back into his house. He lives in a tiny, insulated condo next to my garage. He is just the cutest little guy ever and I love him so much. He even hangs out with the feral cats in the neighborhood. I sometimes see them out there eating out of the dish at the same time. 🥰🥰🥰 I made him a plate of warm food from the meal I was cooking and put it just inside the entrance to the lower level of the condo, so hopefully he liked that."
166,I eat orange!!!!,eh it was good
167,"I adopted a kitty 3 days ago, and I'm so happy that she is in my life that I can barely contain it.","I want to show everyone her photos and videos. I can't stop thinking about her cute little face. I actually look forward to cleaning her cat litter, because it's such a delight to take care of her. She's all black so from a distance, all you see are two little green eyes looking at you from behind a corner. She has tufts of fur along her face that stick straight out like fluffenchops. And she is such a princess, the sassy little shit. <3

The last time I had a healthy cat that was ""mine"" was nearly 10 years ago. He got really sick, and after 4 years of trying to help him, I had to put him to sleep. It really messed me up for a long time, and I still get teary-eyed thinking about it."
168,Full and tired,Just ate dinner that I cooked for me and girlfriend. I haven’t eaten all day. I get light headed from doing this sometimes.
169,One time I used these stick on detox pads on my feet overnight and I woke up with a rash on my face,"The As Seen On TV thing looked pretty cool and I ran across them at Target or something, and I was young and dumb and didn’t know that ‘detoxing’ is bullshit so I bought these stick on pads you put on the bottom of your feet overnight. In the morning they were black and hard, and I had a giant rash on one side of my face."
170,I brought cookies to meet my best friend,"I met my best friend online like 3 years ago, and we've been close for most of that time.  He lives like 8 hours away so we never really drove to meet eachother because neither of us had a car for so long.

Eventually we planned out a couple days together in the city so we could finally get our meeting over with.  I'd never really gone out with anyone even as friends before this, but I figured I would bake cookies.  I made like 50 chocolate chip cookies and we met on this dark street in the city after hunting for eachother for like an hour, where we ate a bunch of them.

It was pretty dope. I never warned him that I was gonna bring cookies, i just did

Standard male Olympic lifting bars weigh 45lbs where standard female Olympic bars weigh 33lbs and are a little more narrow. I thought I was just really strong but I was actually lifting 12lbs less than I thought (pretty significant difference on some lifts). I didnt realize until my last set"
173,"Boyfriend recently got a new 3-D printer. I like the smaller one because it’s a nice, familiar white noise. But the large one‘s y-axis is very loud.","When I woke up early Sunday morning I couldn’t fall back asleep because it was so loud. 

Earlier today boyfriend texted me saying he ordered a part that will make the printer not as loud. 

He’s lovely."
174,We Could Be Heroes,"Alright so a couple months ago I told my friend I had a crush on this girl. My friend helped me psych myself up to ask her out and I kept on chickening out. Over and over again. It was great. This was until one night, this friend was giving me a ride home and she had taken my phone and texted my crush for me. We drive down the road toward my house blasting music because I decided it was best if I didn’t have the ability to hear my thoughts.

About 10 minutes of waiting pass before I get a response. In short she said she wasn’t looking for a relationship because she was leaving soon. That’s all well and good(we are friends now) but in the moment it sucked. And yknow what made it worse? The next song to play, immediately after her response was fucking “Heroes by David Bowie”. That cut deep"
175,My new doctor's office,"Is on the 4th floor of a building so narrow that there is literally one office on each floor. And the elevator is the only thing connecting them.

For some reason the fire exit stairs were locked. And guess who has a giant phobia of elevators! (:

I basically paced the ground floor trying to figure out what to do and trying not to have a panic attack until a few minutes later somebody who also had their appointment at the same dr arrived. And I am significantly less terrified of elevators when there's someone in there with me so I just followed her in thank god.

tl;dr nearly missed my doc appointment because of my stupid phobia"
176,that one snail,"i have several fish tanks and each of them have plants and snails.  one tank has floating plants and every night (sometimes during the day too) there's this one snail who's always up at the top eating them.  there have to be twenty other snails in there but i guess they all must prefer algae.

177,A Funny Thought,"A funny thought popped in my head a few days ago that has caused me to lose some, sleep.  The thought goes something like this: the fundamental component of information is a change. What I mean by this is that if you were to try and communicate or transmit information to another person you would need to create a change.  Whether by changing the tone and pitches of your voice to create sound or changing the letters of the alphabet to develop a word that you can then formulate into a sentence.  So what is the best way to represent this “change,” you can do this a multitude of ways: you can use true or false, spin up or down, or if you want to use a language that all humans intuitively understand you can use mathematics. The simplest way to show change in a mathematical way is (0,1). A person can intuitively see that there was a change in state from zero (nothing) that resulted into one (something). However, like I have mentioned before the values within the parentheses are arbitrary, they are just there to show change, you could show it as (change) if you really wanted to.  Back to my point, this simple “change” of (0,1) gives birth to whole new set of combinations. It gives birth to (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) which essentially is just (0,1) multiplied by itself or (0,1) (0,1). If this is getting more difficult to visualize let me show you like this:

                                            0
                                          (0,1)
                                      (0,1) (0,1)
                             (0,0) (0,1) (1,0) (11)
       (00, 01, 00, 01)(01,00, 11, 10)(11, 11, 01, 01)

So forth and so on until infinity.

From the model you can clearly see that it is expanding at a big rate after every line, getting more and more complex at a rate that’s not just a little not bigger but exponentially bigger. You can denote this by annotating it as 2^X or 2 to the exponent of X, which can be any real number. So for example (2^1)=2, (2^2)=4, (2^3)=8, so forth and so on until infinity.

Which led me to the question what would happen if a person were to expand out this (0,1) to about 13.9 billion years, which is the current age of the universe according to current measurements.  A person can clearly see that it can get incredibly complex, so much so that it can create a complex being like you and I, who can think critically and in abstract ways. So complex that we are beginning to understand the structure of the universe that birthed us.  It makes sense why some people believe in god or a singularity at the beginning of the universe. As vast and complicated our universe is, it ultimately has a structure, it is not random.  The four fundamental forces in physics provides this structure in real life.  The four fundamental forces are the strong force, weak force, electromagnetism, and gravity.  Strong force is what keeps the nucleus together, weak force is what happens when radioactive atoms decay, electromagnetism is electricity and magnetism, and gravity which is what happens when there's mass.  Just because our universe has structure it does not necessarily mean that there is an intelligent creator, however it is a valid idea. Another idea is that we are all somehow in a simulation of some sort, because if we program our computers with (0,1) and we are (0,1) boiled down to our most fundamental components, its very possible that we are stuck in an intricate simulation.  All these ideas are valid until we discover more about the universe or we explore further into “0” or ""nothing.""

    If math is the language of the universe as it is claimed to be, and if my model is correct then we must be a part of a system, what can we relate it this to in real life?  What else in our daily lives behaves this way? What system are you stuck in, what system am I stuck in, or what system are we both stuck in. Here are a few examples:  Capitalism is the economic system of our great nation and when you boil it down to its two main components it is consumption and production. The individual citizens are consuming or producing in order turn the wheels of a giant living organism that we call the US economy and we generate “revenue” for the nation.  Another example is a sperm and an egg, individually they do not amount to much but if you combine them you can spark a change which can create a self-aware and intelligent being. The list can go on and on, but my point still stands. Our whole universe follows a structure, it is a living system made up of infinite systems that gives birth to complex beings.  Could we humans just really be the embodiment of the universe that is trying to understand itself? We are after all just made up of dead stars and galaxies, and when we die we just take on a different form. The laws of physics state that energy can neither be created or destroyed in a closed system, so yes, it is a perfectly viable idea as well.  

Could we be looking at this all wrong and maybe the 0 or singularity that started it all was just some form of a higher dimensional consciousness that imagined us out of nothing.  Like how people can completely be lost about a topic, but after enough exposure and enough information something clicks inside their heads that didn’t exist before.  Maybe we need to reassess our reality, anything that we can imagine or create in our mind is essentially “real” because if you had never thought of it, it would have never existed. Just because its not tangible or physically observable doesn’t mean that it is not real.  We live our lives based on ideas all the time. Whether it be about invisible borders between towns, cities, counties, and countries or maybe our justice system which is based on the idea of morals. So, if we are just the imagination of a higher dimensional consciousness, I can only imagine that you, the reader, and I are blowing this things mind!  It’s quite possible that each single human, all 8 billion of us, could be the working neurons of a higher dimensional brain. All our experiences, all the hate, love, and epiphanies are all watched, felt, and quite possibly understood.
 
I realize that everything that I’ve said is highly improbable and sits on the border of insanity and reality.  So I implore you to help me find my mistakes, share this with other people and see what they think.  Our reality is only limited by our imagination.  "
178,Yesterday I did leg day for the first time,Now sitting on the toilet bowl hurts!
179,One time I sold some books on ebay and the guy said he never got them.,"He wanted his money back and I told him no, here's your tracking number, it shows that I shipped them and they got delivered.  
He asked for his money back anyway.  
Told him ""Sorry, but I did my part so it's on you to report a missing package to the post office or police"".  

He reported me to ebay but I showed them the proof and they didn't make me give his money back. Dude left positive feedback but whined in the notes about having the package stolen. Somehow that's my fault?  

**edit**: I'm sorry this story might have had a little bit of a point. my bad"
180,Minecraft coincidence,"So yesterday I was playing Minecraft on Jupiter with some friends. We decided to join a Minecraft hunger games lobby. So basically, my Minecraft skin was set to DIO from jojos bizarre adventure, and I happened to run into a guy with a skin of “The World” (DIO’s stand). So I sat there like “damn what a surprise!”"
181,my coworker has smelly poop,"I felt really nauseous at work, so I ran to the bathroom. One of my coworkers had just left (toilet was freshly running and everything) and it smelled so bad in there. The smell was so pungent that it made my nausea go away, just so I wouldn’t have to throw up in that toilet"
182,Lauren,"Oh, Lauren. She was such a cool girl! Not amazing, but already better than the batch I met before. Artistic, funny blue-haired girl. Not only that, but she was also passionate about music.

When I downloaded Tinder again, in 2019, she’s the first who talked to me. She found my profile funny, I found her nice. She was a university student, also part of a comity, which took half of her free time, but she didn’t want to quit cause she didn’t wanna fuck everything up there. I was at “college”, after quitting 8 times and I was gonna leave this time again, but later.

We met in real life, she was really quiet, very shy I’d say. We started drinking and she became less and less shy. Those moments, tipsy or whatever, were amazing. I like talking, and not alone, so it was cool. We weren’t drunk at all, but we both saw something weird in the sky. Three rows of 3 long bright lines moving forward, then disappearing in the dark sky. We both had no explanation. I’m glad we both saw it, otherwise I would’ve thought I was crazy, but perhaps we were both. It wasn’t the first time something weird happened, but that’s for later.

It was late, we weren’t close to her house, nor mine, but mine was closer. There was no bus, so we decided to both go at my house because she didn’t have a lot of cash, and it was good that way.

My tinder bio had a joke on it, but also a small paragraph telling I didn’t want to have a girlfriend, nor have sex, I just wanted a friend. We arrived home, went to bed. There was no plan to have sex. It felt bizarre to both sleep in the bed and not spoon, so I went like “Is it ok if we spoon?”. She said yes. We both felt asleep.

We both woke up around 3 AM. I don’t know what went on, but we jumped on each other and started fucking. I’m not against sex, but I’m so bad at it I didn’t wanna meet someone only for that.

That was the start of us, as dating mates. It was ok because we were still free and didn’t feel trapped in anything. We weren’t a couple but even without really talking about it, we were exclusive. Probably because we were to ugly-ass hipsters.

We‘s see each other frequently, she was cool! She was always shy, we’d always get drunk. She was super affectionate, though. She’d also always try to suck my cock. Like always. I was stopping her most of the time because I was feeling like it was weird, getting my dick sucked and that’s it.

There weren’t a lot of things I didn’t like about her, but I wasn’t a big fan of her art. I know it sounds dumb but art says a lot about someone, music tastes too. Her music tastes were fine, but it was always the same thing. I started joking about how all her favorite songs sounded like Twenty One Pilots. We had this collaborative playlist on Spotify, we’d put one song after the other in it. I knew she didn’t like my music, unless it was exactly her style. I’d put songs I didn’t love just so she doesn’t feel like half the playlist is shit.

We were dating for a month and a half. We were fine most of the time and it was really a simple relationship. One day, I’d make her pick a card out of a deck and guess it. I noticed her card had a little white dot on it, so I knew which card it was. She was amazed. We did it again, and I guessed the right card twice on three shots. No white dot, I guessed them right for some reason. She wasn’t bullshitting me because I’d ask her to tell me the card she picked, I would then throw them and pick one, and it was the one. I even put my finger on one, said it wasn’t the right one but the one under, and it was. It’s hard to explain but there was no way for me to know which card it was. It was just luck.

We stopped seeing each other for around a week, after a month and a half of seeing each other two to four times a week. We kept on texting but not a lot. I didn’t feel so good about the relationship anymore. She didn’t really do anything, but I was off.

No matter how the rest of this post looks, just know that I’m the asshole in this situation. I’ve always tried to make sure everybody knows we weren’t official, that we stopped talking for a week or two, but I’m a fucking asshole, and I accept it.

One night, I received a message on Instagram. Some girl wanted to tell me something about one of my posts. I scrolled up, saw that we had a conversation in 2017. I realized we met on Tinder, back in 2017 before I deleted the app. I told her, she replied that her conversation was cleared, so I sent her some screenshots. We started talking, we decided we could meet for fun.

We met, one night. We went to walk from her apartment to a convenient store. We purchased some alcohol. Some time later we were both drunk. She said she wanted me to go to her apartment with her. We both went. She offered me some weed, I took some. It was the third time in my life I would smoke weed, I’ve always tried not to take drugs until recently. I don’t know what happened; I was fucked. Perhaps it wasn’t only weed, perhaps it was because it hit for the first time. My teeth felt like fucking melting or something.

I sat on her bed, put some music on her TV. The Blaze’s “Territory”. I had to save that moment, cause I like to save such moments, so I started recording with snapchat to save it to my memories. I don’t know what went on, and let me sound like an even worse asshole, but even if I didn’t find that girl attractive, we started kissing and then we fucked.

I was gonna see Lauren the next day. I got out of the bus from that other girl, received a instagram message from Lauren. “Nice story” she said. “What story?” I replied, I had no story. She was talking about my Snapchat story. Fuck. 30 seconds of “Territory” on a tv, filmed on a bed which wasn’t mine, along with a dark video with kissing sounds.

I sabotaged myself to get out of whatever was between Lauren and I. As least that’s what I like to think. I like to think that I didn’t wanna make her sad, so I’d made her furious? Writing this, it doesn’t really make any sense, but what happened happened.

She stopped talking to me, I never talked with the other girl, and there was I, alone again."
183,I told a friend about Reddit and she really likes it.,"She's in her mid-50s. I told her about Reddit recently, because she has this horrible narcissistic mother and had a difficult holiday season dealing with her family. So I just wanted to point out that there's lots of other people going through a similar thing, and texted her the link to  r/raisedbynarcissists. She spent like half a day reading through the posts and kept texting me excerpts and how she couldn't believe how similar the stories were to hers. That was like 2 weeks ago, and she just told me yesterday that she found some subreddits related to her hobbies and how much she likes those too."
184,killed a mosquito today... in january,"i was finishing dishes at the kitchen sink and saw the awful gangly specter of a flying mosquito land on the counter just inches from my hand.  before thinking, i crushed it.  where the hell did it come from?  it's the middle of january in canada."
185,When I was 5 I was approached by a strange older man,"He put his hand on my shoulder and asked if I sold jerky. I said, not to you, jerky!

He left me alone

But I saw him again when I left the train with my pa

He was eating jerky"
186,I just found out someone I used to chat with online died 7 days ago.,"A fellow unschooling mom who I used to chat with about kids, video games, and Linux passed away 7 days ago and I feel awful because I just found out about it because her son posted on the Minecraft server they ran together (not on Facebook where all of us would see it) where another online friend saw it and mentioned it in a small Facebook group. 

Having most of your friends online is weird. And since we have known each other most of our kids' lives and we are getting older more of us are going to pass and not be nearby to comfort family and friends. And that is sad and weird."
187,‘Dog Treats’,"So I was just chilling on he couch, eating some beef jerky when my dog walks in and just stares at me and I realized
I just pulled a piece of meat that looks kinda like a dog treat out of a similar bag that her treats would come in"
188,"My SO is sleeping and said in his sleep, “oh, but would you have a sandwich?”",I snorted with laughter and a snot bubble came out of my nose.
189,I’m eating pizza and having an SVU marathon,"I haven’t eaten much all day except hot Cheetos bc I’m broke and that’s all I have right now til payday.
I’m bored so I’ve been watching SVU most of today."
190,An interesting non encounter,"Background: I am in college and there’s this one guy, I think his name is Matthew, I think a mutual friend introduced us once but we never talked or hung out. Regardless we know who the other one is and we see each other all the time. We never say hi, we just exchange weird glances. 

Well anyway, during Christmas break, me and a few friends go to Gatlinburg, which is like 4 hours away from my college. We’re sitting at a restaurant, when all of a sudden who do I see... 

That’s right! Matthew!! We do not say hi, we simply exchange awkward glances and will probably never speak of this"
191,I had a throat problem,"For some time, I had a problem where my throat would suddenly close up and make me gag, usually at the mention of food or a bad stench. Finally had enough and went to the doctor and the doctor asked the usual questions and said it was most likely stomach acid hitting my vocal cords. He gave me a prescription for some pills and told me to take one a day for three weeks.

I did so and since then I haven’t had the issue, but I lost my appetite. I used to have an iron stomach. I could eat a bowl of cereal, several chocolate bars, and drink a big glass of chocolate milk in one sitting and not even get so much as a stomachache. Now, I can hardly eat more than half a chicken strip without getting a strange feeling, not really a sick feeling, but an odd, almost empty feeling and it wouldn’t go away until I put the chicken back in the refrigerator.

Now, I usually lose my appetite at night, so I eat fine during the day, still not nearly as much as I used to, but a fair amount. Nighttime rolls around and the thought of eating makes me feel weird."
192,I got to train someone today!,As a cashier. Things lined up pretty well cause I got some good examples of everything. Someone did a return. Someone needed jewelry. People asked where things were. And someone was an asshole who for some reason thought it was okay to yell at the two of us and roughly grab my hand in anger and I got to explain retail diplomacy: instead of saying “get your filthy fucking hands off me” you give them the axe murder eyes and say “have a good day!”
193,I was an offended nine-year-old,"When I was nine, my mom made me a Facebook account so I could play games. My favorite game to play was called Petville. I loved playing it and I got my mom, and my grandma, and a few other family members to play it too. And one day I got my dad to play it. I was so excited because I loved having new pet friends for my pet. He shared some notification on Facebook that was something like “meet my Petville pet, Funky!” And then one of his friends commented “someone shoot that thing.”  

I was so upset and angry that someone would say that. Little 9 year old me was horrified someone could be so heartless, as I held Petville near and dear to my heart. I went to my dad all upset he’s like “oh, he was just joking” to try and comfort me. But I took that stupid comment so personally. 

I look back on it and just laugh now."
194,This story I found on a YouTube comments section on how he/she thought the Nazis were fictional,">I'd love to hear more of these, Doug!
Here's a great story about how the media impacted me when I was a kid. I was maybe 7 or 8 and my family were all attending a kid's art class. We had to draw hot air balloons with designs on them, and one of the very first things I drew on my hot air balloon was the Swastika!! The only thing I had seen it in until that point was the Indiana Jones movies, so I just thought ""Oh, I'll draw the symbol that the bad guys have in Indiana Jones!"" I thought the Nazis were fictional! XD

[here is set video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STOmR_nzE8w) as I set i found the story in the comments section, so sorry if you dont find it. also the video it self has a funny story on how Ghostbusters Drinking Got the YouTube Sent to the Principal"
195,"I was in my room with the door open, singing a South Park song.","The PC song to be specific. I got to the lyric ""I call WOO WOO on you!"" I guess I was really into it, mocking the guys voice and everything because my mom yelled at me to shut the fuck up from the living room."
196,The popular music from my high school days is now being played on the old people radio station,"It makes me feel old.  I remember my first job.  I was a dishwasher at a club where retired alcoholics hang out.  My coworkers would always have on the popular, new music radio station that the young people listen to.  I’ve always been more of a rock music guy, but I can enjoy pop and hip hop.  

I remember hearing these songs on the radio at my first job when they were still new songs.  I really liked some of them.  It would make me happy every time I heard them on the radio even if I heard them multiple times a day, and as time went on, and new songs kept coming out, I would start to miss the songs from months previous that they didn’t play anymore.

Now, these songs are on one of the old people radio stations.  My current coworkers are mostly 40+.  They’ll always put on this one radio station that mixes popular “new” music (songs from 2015 are the newest that they’ll play) with the old hits that they grew up with.  When I hear these songs now, it doesn’t make me happy.  It annoys me.  Instead of being cool new songs, they are now overplayed, old songs from years past.  I miss the days when I actually enjoyed these songs."
197,My floor used to glow,"When I was a kid I got this really cool solar system model, it had all of the planets (this is before there were only eight) and the sun, and the planets were relatively the right sizes compared to each other. Being the unfocused kid that I was I never put it together, but I did have fun with the glow in the dark paint that came with it. Until I spilled all of the paint on my carpet. In the daylight the paint and the carpet were the same color so the only way to tell something was wrong if it was light out was the stiffer section of carpet, but over the years it softened up and was indistinguishable from the rest of the carpet, if it was lit. If it was night and the lights were off there was an obvious large patch of carpet that glowed. 

Years after I spilled it the house was sold, but really, who looks at a house in the dark before they buy one? No way the new owners knew about the weirdly glowing patch before they closed and moved in."
198,My cat is snoring on my bed and it makes me happy,"I have a final in a few minutes and I’m kinda stressing, but my cat that I’ve had for almost 14 years is sleeping so soundly on the bed next to me. It’s just so relaxing to hear its breath and to know it feels safe and relaxed besides me, it really calms me down."
199,Vegan dreams,I had a dream last night that I was telling my mate I was doing veganuary (I am in real life) and he told me to prove it and speak in vegan then
200,I’ve never felt so bad in my life...,"I always thought I was strong, emotionally. I’ve never been anxious, I’ve never been depressed. I like to say I only have emotions for positive things; that I’m never sad, that I’m never down.

I’ve been in multiple relationships, but I’ve never really loved. I could easily get out of relationships without feeling bad, and I never felt dependent. It’ll sound bad, but one of my exes filled a test online to see if I was a sociopath. Turns out, according to that website, that I wasn’t.

I’m not saying everything is perfect. I’m pretty sure I have ADHD or at least ADD, but I’m too much of a coward to even ask about it. The last time I really went out of my comfort zone to get medical help, it was to make sure my penis was fine. Imagine having a hard time reading books, not doing anything about it, but as soon as there might be a problem with your dick, you jump in the first bus to get it fixed.

I’ve always avoided medical stuff, too scared of having anything. Recently though, I did it, took blood tests. I thought I was super lazy for not taking them before, but apparently it was the contrary: nobody does blood tests at 22, apparently. Just so this paragraph doesn’t look too short, I had nothing. No aids, no diabetes. I was fine.

I became motivated in fixing my life, cleaning my room, getting my bank and goverment stuff updated, even started cleaning my Iphone photos. It all came around the same time: when I met someone I loved, for real this time.

Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t know I wasn’t in love with my exes. I thought what I was feeling for them was love, but it wasn’t. It wasn’t because I’ve felt with the girl I met something I never felt before.

That girl, she’s leaving in another country. I’ve always been lazy about everything, but trust me, something happened with her. I got all my shit done, passport, photos, contacts, plane tickets, etc. I’ve done it all to go see her 3 weeks later. It was super early in our “relationship” but it felt like the good decision. And it was.

English isn’t my native language, please forgive me.

The trip was amazing, but I didn’t feel as good as I could. It was physical laziness, I was feeling weak. It was fucking with my whole self. It wasn’t that bad and everything went super well. We were in love and we’re still in love.

I came back, twelve days later. It was after she went to the airport with me. I had tears in my eyes and she didn’t, but I’d guess she was trying not to cry, or she just knew we’d still be there, together.

I wanted to cry so much. I never cry for real life situations, almost never. I cried after admitting to my ex I cheated on her, I cried when my other ex cheated on me. But other than that, I would only cry watching movies and shows. Me & Earl & the Dying Girl, or Andy talking about good old times on The Office, Why would I cry there?

In the best case scenario, I would feel good right now. She’s still in love with me, she’s coming to see me soon! I should feel like life’s good, finally. Life has always been ok, never that bad, never that good. **The love of my life loves me so much she’s coming to see me**. Yea, I should feel good.

I came back home from my trip. I slept normally, I don’t have any problem falling asleep, and I didn’t that night too, but I wake up wanting to die, literally.

I’ve never felt so fucking bad in my life. I didn’t even know what was going on. Some kind of pain in my chest. Google says anxiety, Google says depression. But what is it really? Dependency?

I went on Reddit recently, asking about people’s experiences (don’t look at my profile, it’s pathetic). Most of the people shared that feeling, but holy shit, it’s so bad.

And then, I started being shit, shit with her. Not that bad, and we’re still together, but my self-confidence, or whatever is it, is going downhill. I’m trying to change, to fix myself, but it’s so hard!

I would always have something to say, now I cannot find anything. I don’t know what to send, I don’t know what to reply, I don’t know how to react, I don’t know how to talk, to laugh, when to laugh. We keep on saying “I love you” but it’s so much, it seems like we’re trying to fill the lack of conversation by telling each other we love them, **but what the fuck do you reply to “I love you too”?** I fucking love you more? And then what?

Trust me, it’s not a rant about her. She’s perfect. She’s probably trying to handle my shitty behaviors, my boredom. It must be so hard. She’s trying to reassure me, that things are gonna be ok, that we’re both there, BUT I CANNOT CHANGE HOW I FEEL! HOW DO I DO FROM NOW?

I feel like shit, how do I fix that? I don’t wanna leave her! How will I feel then!? What do I do? What do I do.

I’m overanalyzing everything. It looks like by trying to find what could be wrong, I’m destroying our relationship, us. It’s clearly not what I want, but I don’t know how to do!

~~See, I’m sometimes taking screenshots of her, when we’re talking with the camera, or when she sends me photos. I’m not screenshotting anothing bad, only her cute face, the face I like the most. One time I’m like: “Do you wanna marry me”.~~ Dude, I don’t even wanna tell that fucking story, it’s pathetic.

When I was a kid, I felt so bad about my parents treating me worse than I thought I deserved. I wrote them a letter, telling them it wasn’t their fault. In my head I was gonna kill myself. I started crying and banging my head on whatever was hard and in my way. I couldn’t kill myself.

I don’t remember much about it, I remember where I was, how the room looked, the size of the paper, where I banged my head. Just enough to know that how I feel right now is worse than then. At that age, if I could’ve gone inside my head and go around my shitty personality, superiority complex or whatever it was, I would’ve seen that my mom loves me, even if she doesn’t want me to play Runescape. That my dad loves me even if he’s mad I suck at school.

But right now, I cannot even put my finger on what the fuck is happening inside of me. I’m not gonna kill myself, I’ve thought about it enough; I’ll probably fuck my life up before anything. We only have one life to live, eh?"
201,You ever just stir the air with your arm?,Im caffeinated to blitz and I can’t feel anything woooo
202,i keep getting zest in my eyes,"i go to bed pretty early but always stay up late in my room on the computer or reading and usually end up getting hungry before i fall asleep.  so that i don't have to get up in the night and go downstairs to the fridge, i make sure i have a bottle of water and some fruit when i go to bed.  lately i've had really good luck choosing nice oranges at the grocery store so that's what i've been bringing to bed with me.  also, i sleep with a fan on and have for years.  i need the noise and air flow or i have trouble sleeping.  the past couple of nights i keep doing the same stupid thing and peeling my orange right in front of the fan.  zest squirts out of the skin and the fan blows it directly into my eyes.  it's not a pleasant feeling."
203,white boy bro offends black friend,"I'm sitting here in the common room of the student union at my community college (I'm not college age, 28) & most of the ppl in the SUB are under 25.

There's this loud co-ed group of friends. Anyway, as they're playing cards this white kid yells out the N word & gets chastiiiiiiized hahaha"
204,I moved around my entire work schedule to enable me to go to class on Thursday nights.,My first class was supposed to be tonight but I just realized that it’s only an online class.
205,I have a six year old jar of pickles in my fridge.,This jar of pickles is old and the juice is milky in appearance. I want to see how long I can keep it for.
206,I saw a UFO and nobody believes me,"About 2 years ago I was on break at work having a cigarette when I saw this small group of lights appear from behind the restaurant behind us (we take smoke breaks in the back, so i was facing it). I’ve never seen anything move like that. It was NOT a drone and everybody I tell this story chalks it up to that. I can’t really describe the way it moved, almost like it was hovering. I stood there in literal shock watching this thing hover away, towards the mall which is across the street. I ran inside to tell my coworker as soon as I came to my senses and he thought I was crazy, but I know what I saw!"
207,I was withdrawing from a drug and didn't realize it.,"I've been feeling achey, tired and suffering a pounding headache for the last day. I bought an espresso to give me some needed boost. My symptoms vanished within 30 minutes. I think the coffee I've been making at home is decaff, even though the container says otherwise."
208,the disappearing train,"my mum was driving my friends back to his house (we had a play date) and we use the free way. I looked to my right and saw a train next to us, looked away for 3 seconds then it was gone. it wasn’t behind us or in front since there was a train station and it would have stopped.

this story wasn’t good enough to be on r/paranormal so it’s here lmao"
209,Tale of the Tomato Sea,"Once upon a time, there was a ship. A bird shat on the deck then it went for the sun. Now it lives there. 
The water was tomato sauce and the ship was made of diamonds. The sails were made of bird feathers. And the main deck was plastic. 
The Captain said, ""Why is that tree?""
And everyone started to whistle. Including the cat. 
The mouse only had 2 buttons and not the scroll one.
Then suddenly a whale jumped out of the water. It flapped its fin and it said ""blob plop gobly flysss"". And the crew began to dance. The cat was not dancing because it was already served on the table. The queen loved the taste of it.
But the Captain said not to dance because the Wi-Fi was gone. 
Then the crew started to make an app. The idea was that if you could draw a perfect chicken in the app, the phone would lay an egg. But if it's not good enough, then the chicken would simply cross the road. The app wasn't easy to make because the eggs keep coming out made of gold. Everyone hated that. 
A maid came and told about the cyborg on board. It only ate the mouse with two buttons. 

In the sea of tomato sauce, all pirates are Italian. 
And if you want some flavor
Just add some scallions. 

But why is the spaghetti not ready? 
Because there are no owls in the outer space."
210,I was at the soda machine,"This happened about a year ago. It was a minimum day at my highschool, the California sun reached into the 100s and my brokeass school didn't have no air conditioning. Everybody was sweating balls out there, you know how it is.

So anyways, I met up with my cousin and we made plans to go eat some pizza and get sodas to cool off. I honestly don't get a lot of time to spend with her cause of her controlling parents and our different friend groups, so I was trying to fit in as much stories as I could. Sadly, this led me to blabbering out loud the fact that I hadn't pee'd in literal days. My bladder was at a complete standstill and I don't know what the fuck I was thinking, but I thought it'd be funny if I said it out loud. 

So there I was, getting Powerade at the soda machine when this really cute girl walks up to me. Now let's be clear, I am a lesbian, so while this looked like any other altercation on the outside, the inside workings were very...different.

""You should probably go see a doctor if you haven't peed in a week. Trust me, I'm a nursing student ""

.That's literally all she said to me and as my cup overfilled with powerade I could feel my soul withering in the background of my cousin's ugly hacking laughter."
211,Met a lovely cat during my run today,"I was running today when I saw a cat up ahead on the opposite side of the sidewalk. So I cross the street so that we would cross paths. I ran up to the cat and started petting it and it was meowing at me, then it was rubbing against my legs and I told him that I had to continue on my run. Of course the cat did not understand, and started trotting along with me. So then I had to wait for the crosswalk instead of jaywalking like I normally do, because I didn't want the cat to get confused and then get run over by a car. Luckily when I crossed the street he stayed behind. I waved goodbye.

The truth is I ran to that part of town today specifically to see a cat (there's a lot of outdoor cats over there) so I'm really pleased that I accomplished that. I love that running gives me an excuse to do such a thing."
212,"At work, I have a fan on my desk that I turn on whenever I fart.",That's it.
213,Phantom milfs appeared out of nowhere,"I'm an adult now. This was years ago, but it haunts me. 

I'm about sixteen and it's Christmas day. I live in a strictly Catholic household. The closest I've ever gotten to viewing pornography is steamy softcore fanfiction.  I am innocent. 

It's that part of the afternoon where everyone is nursing sugar headaches and figuring out their new tech. I'm in my room fiddling with a new laptop or a new phone or new software or something. 

My room's a total mess-- there are archaeological layers of items that have been building up since my childhood. On my bookshelf there's a fat stack of CDs given to me by various jazz mentors. I play jazz saxophone, and every man who ever taught me jazz liked to throw CDs at me and go ""Listen to the greats! Play along with the recordings!"" 

My parents got a new speaker system, and my mom bursts into my room looking for some jazz CDs to test on the speaker system. She's riffling through a stack of CDs on my bookshelf when I hear, ""What's this?"" 

What follows is burned into my brain forever. My mother is brandishing a CD. I read the words on the label: \*All actors portrayed in these videos were over 18 and consented.\* I see the word \*Milf\*. 

""Do you know what this is?"" my mother says. 

""I've never seen this before in my life,"" I say, because it's the truth. I begin to realize what it is. ""Please get rid of it. I don't want it in here."" 

My mother clearly does not believe me but takes it away to the paper shredder to be disposed of. She presumably spends the rest of my teenage years wondering if I'm some kind of pervert. I spend the rest of my life terrified that pornography is going to materialize in my living space."
214,I blew bubbles into my fizzy water and it went flat,"Poured a nice can of lemon-lime fizzy water into a nice Yeti cup, threw a nice metal straw in there.  Started blowing bubbles. What fun this is, I thought. Super cool, super fizzy, extremely entertaining...then the fizzy water was fizzy no longer."
215,the first time i ever saw porn,"I was in 4th grade and beavers were my favorite animal so I Googled ""beaver pics"""
216,Yet another reason why I refuse to talk to people I don’t know well at school,"I was in forensics class today (I’m a senior in HS), and the group I was in got on the topic of the dark web.  Most folks at school know me as a nerd.  I love computers/electronics, and plan on majoring in computer engineering in college.  I also really love aviation, a bit of photography, and sometimes learning about animals.  

I told my group how I visited the dark web, what the difference is between the dark web and the deep web, as well as how the dark web is accessed.  When people start asking me about technology-related topics, I really go off on a tangent.  

I then pulled out my phone, and showed them this IP scanner app I had.  This girl I kinda like was a bit scared, as she thought my app was “too much.”  With the app, I can only see IP addresses of devices connected to the network I’m on.  That’s all I am able to do with it, as I don’t know much about software, but I’m sure a professional hacker could do a whole lot more.

The IP scanner app impressed some people I my group.  We talked some more, then they got on the topic of being introverted and all that.  The girl I like (I always thought she was super popular) said that she was very introverted, and that’s the reason why she refuses to go to prom and school concerts.  A few other people stated how they were “introverts” and all that.  

I wanted to talk more about my technical stuff, as I rarely get this opportunity.  It makes me feel good inside to know someone actually wants to hear what’s gonna come out of my mouth.

So then I tried to show my group how I can get pictures from weather satellites using a radio receiver, a custom-made yagi antenna, and some free decoding software.

For those who don’t know what I’m talking about, you can get images from polar-orbiting NOAA satellites on the 137MHz-138MHz band.  NOAA-19 is on 137.100MHz if I remember correctly.  I can’t remember the frequencies of NOAA-18 or NOAA-15.  They’re the only operational NOAA satellites that still transmit APT (automatic picture transmission).

Anyways, I kinda did this to impress that girl, as I liked her, and she was going to an Ivy League (she likes telling people about that, and I don’t blame her).  One thing led to another, and I forget what question it was, but my answer was “I enjoy talking to adults more than people my age, as they understand what I’m talking about.”  
No, I’m not r/iamverysmart.  I realized my wording error, but it was too late. 

This one person in the group kinda joked with me, and said “so you’re saying we’re too dumb for you?”  I said “no, not that” and “it’s just that adults I talk with tend to understand what I’m talking about.  I get my share of not-so-good grades, I’m not as smart as you think.  I got a C in Chem.”  

The girl I liked said something like how she doesn’t understand my tech lingo, and is scared of my tech knowledge.  She was kinda understanding after I told her how I was going to major in computer engineering, but I felt like a complete dick.  

Did I mess up and make myself look like a moron?  I feel like I left a bad impression.  My friend tells me I didn’t, but I want to see what you all think."
217,took a nap with the dog,"in the morning, our family dog (ten month old standard poodle pushing fifty pounds) likes to sit on someone's lap.  once she gets comfortable, she usually starts snoring after a few minutes.  i had nothing going in this morning so i fell asleep with her.  i was laying an my back with her stretched out on top and we napped for an hour.  i think she woke up first, which woke me up because it was a light sleep.  it was sweet.  for the rest of the day, i think she felt more bonded to me than usual.  we had a good day."
218,Deleted all my social media,"I deleted all my social media last week and immediately feel so much better. I barely used Twitter but it was a toxic place. Instagram was alright but I hate the celeb and model culture on there. Facebook was the last one left but I dislike all the meme sharing and stuff on there so that went too. I can still use messenger though which is good, as I have a few people I only talk to on there, and messenger was the only part of Facebook I used anyway. Plus at least with Facebook it’s just deactivated until I decide I want to resume it one day.

I think it’s had a massive positive affect on my wellbeing to not feel the need to ‘check anything’ anymore. The people I care about can contact me via phone/text/email anyway."
219,I got a new sweatshirt today!,"I got it from The Yetee a couple weeks ago and it finally came! It has Usagi (Sailor Moon) sitting on a crescent moon and it glows in the dark, when it glows in the dark Usagi is transformed into Sailor Moon and it has the rest of the Sailor Soldiers, Tuxedo Mask, and the cats in the moon. It's really big and soft and comfy and I just love it."
220,"I work with a personal trainer that is a small, old lady. My therapist looks like a male body builder.",Idk just seems like those stereotypes are reversed.
221,I almost drowned myself in my morning cup of coffee.,"   ""The bottom of that coffee is getting cold,"" I thought to myself, ""If I finish it quickly, I can grab the last fresh cup from the pot.""

     It seemed like a good idea in theory. I grabbed my mug and threw my head back. Perhaps it was the stale, dry, air; heating a home in the depths of a Canadian winter regularly messes with my breathing. Perhaps it was my eagerness to move on to a fresh cup of joe. Perhaps it was the devil himself who decided to reach up from hell with a fiery finger and dry out a small patch in my throat. 

       Whatever decided to curse me, my brain and body noticed two things at the same time: 1) I was about to cough; 2) I had just closed my lips around as much coffee as I could dump in my mouth. This wasn't going to end well for my new bed and fresh linen.

         I sprang up from my half-assed, cross legged Buddha pose. I slapped my right hand firmly across my mouth and nose. Spraying my notes, my clean clothes, and the white walls of my new apartment was NOT an option. 

      Liquids can be clever little Houdinis; they will seek escape by any means, and a mouth clamped shut necessitates evacuation through the nose.

     My jaw is clamped shut, reinforced by willpower and my hand. I forced my brain to send the executive order to calmly swallow. I should have pinched my nose, sadly, breathing seemed the better option. 

      The demon coffee rose through my sinus cavity. I clamped my hand tighter over my face as my deepest love betrayed me. My hand filled with lukewarm, sticky, viscous, brown go juice just as the sputter escaped my throat and the urge to breathe became automatic. 

    I am certain tears of warm coffee flowed even from my tear ducts. My eyes blurry and lungs burning, I raced for paper towel. Crisis averted: Only drips on the tile floor. 

The best part of waking up IS NOT Folgers in your cough."
222,I farted on the bus before I got off at my stop.,"I had really bad gut rot from drinking and eating wings the night before. My farts were absolutely toxic. I was on a bus crammed full. I pulled the chord for my stop, dropped a deadly shit cloud and quickly got off at my stop. I regret nothing."
223,Got my cousin an awesome birthday present,"Me and my cousin (age 8) don’t get along very well, he has autism and can be quite loud and overwhelming (especially for someone who’s extremely sensitive to sound). But this year I tried really hard to get him a birthday gift he’d really love. Considered so many different presents and finally settled on a Snorlax plushie, as Snorlax is his favourite Pokemon. Even though he can be very difficult to be around his reaction when he opened it was so priceless. I loved seeing him so happy and it was very gratifying (is that the right word?) knowing I was the reason he was happy."
224,[Spoiler] The ending of Moral Orel is so heart-breaking. It was just on TV and is one of the saddest endings I’ve ever seen.,"The adult swim show Moral Orel is about a Mega-Christian kid in a very Christian town. Each episode, he miss interprets a lesson taught by the Bible and runs into conflicts. His father is an alcoholic and always hits him with a belt in his ‘study’ when Orel miss interprets a lesson. He doesn’t quite understand the world around him and is very adamant about going to church and bible study. Every episode ends fine and everything makes up.

However the final episode [‘Grounded’](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6n98ki), Orel is grounded for having a blood party and making a mess with the neighborhood kids (I’m not very religious so i don’t understand the context to it). His father decides to put a much more severe punishment on Orel other than hitting him with his belt. He’s not allowed to go to church for 1 whole month. 

Due to the overwhelming love of church by Orel, his father knows this is a severe punishment for him. Orel doesn’t seem to cope with this punishment well. He is seen going insane in his room writing biblical verses on the wall and tally marks. His father sees this and continues to rub in the fact the rest of the family keeps going to church, talking about how great it is. Orel builds a replica one, but gets taken by his father. Orel has a better idea to get religion back in his life.

Orel is going to meet God himself. 

Orel tries to kill himself, and sees a new world in his death. Sadly his plan is foiled as a doctor Resuscitates him. So, he asks his best friend to help kill him to get to the other side. After dying multiple times, the doctor keeps bringing him back. During the last time he tries, when he is revived his father asks “did you see the white clouds? The pearly gates of Heaven?” And Orel says “well, not exactly....” and gets cut off. His father asks Orel if he’d like to go on a nature trip. Orel is enthusiastic to do something with his father and looks for his love & guidance. His father drinks, and then shoots Orel, ending the show once and for all.

A real tear-jerker. As a huge fan of the show, I’m sad to see it end like this and it troubles me so much that a kid who was just trying to do the right thing was always shut down. No one should ever be denied of their love of a subject, no matter the consequences."
225,"I am waiting in the doctor’s office and it finally dawns on me, I need to get a swivel stool",
226,A lady in the parking lot couldn't figure out how to fold up her new stroller,"I was walking into a hospital for an appointment and these two ladies were fiddling with a stroller. One of them asked me if I knew how to fold it up, and I said I didn't but that I'd try to help. The other lady high-tailed it out of there as soon as I agreed, so she must have been flagged down too. 

We spent about 8-10 minutes trying to figure it out. I ended up googling it and it took a few videos before we found one that wasn't twenty minutes long.

Turns out you just pull up on a little handle on the seat. It's the easiest thing I've ever done, and we both felt very stupid."
227,I decided to be funny and send my girl a pic of me while I’m taking a shit (neck up) and she said I looked hot... i don’t know if I should tell her I’m taking a fat shit rn,
228,Musical Octopus,"My daughter has a toy octopus and each leg is a different note when you squeeze it. Also, it blasts out a strong vanilla scent. It's the most random thing but I'm an almost 40 year old guy and I like playing with it."
229,I went to the garage to piss,"So my family moved to Germany. It was our first week there and we staying in the Marriott. Well I decide to pull an all nighter and play a ton of Minecraft and roblox. I drink a lot of water and didn’t take a piss for about 4 hours. By this time it’s like 8 in the morning. My mom asks me to go down to the garage and pull something out of the car so I do. There was this nice red Ferrari in the garage and I really needed to go. In my tired mind I go over to the Ferrari whip out my dick and start pissing on the Ferrari. I then went to my car grabbed what my mom wanted then went back to my room. Nothing happened I just pissed on a Ferrari then went back.


TLDR: I pissed on a Ferrari."
230,I threw a green apple over the fence into someone’s yard,"It was old and I wanted to dispose of it ~naturally~ so I chucked it in the backyard, only I horrendously miscalculated my strength and ended up throwing it over the fence. Some dog started barking, I ran inside and started freaking out because I thought those people were gonna come pound on my door and bitch at me. I was also high so that probably explains it. They never came :-]"
231,The guy I like cut his hair,"He had a really long hair and he cut it so short! He looks so nice and he has such a beautiful hair. But I'll miss caressing his hair, at least he kept the beard.
I bothered him until he sent me a picture and I just can't stop looking at it he is so gorgeous."
232,My milk expired today,"The milk went to waste, no one drank it. We had half a gallon of milk left. It all had to go down the drain because it was sour. We have so much milk left in our fridge and someone opened the other gallon. They started drinking from that one and let this one go sour. Then we have a smaller carton. Who bought so much milk? Not me, I only put a splash in my coffee every now and then."
233,I stabbed myself with and EpiPen on accident.,"  When I was eight, my parents took me to go see extended family so they could babysit me while my parents could have a break away from life issues. I was in the back seat of my Aunt's car with her daughter while they were getting gas. This was back when my allergies were a bit severe, so My parents had an adult carry an EpiPen around at all times. For some reason my aunt left the EpiPen in in the back seat with me and my cousin. In case you've never owned an EpiPen, they come with a practice version so you can learn how to use one. I, being the eight yr old idiot I was, mistook the real EpiPen for the fake one and stabbed myself through the thumb. Let's just say my aunt was horrified.
  She ended up calling an ambulance, and they came pretty fast. Luckily not enough medicine from the EpiPen was injected into my thumb. If so I wouldn't have my thumb today.

  Yeah we got rid of EpiPen asap."
234,Fuck your small talk.,"Fuck small talk. I don't care how you are, I don't care about your job, your kids, your fucking house, the fucking sports garbage, your fucking social circle, your religion. If I start a conversation, I have a reason to start that conversation. None of that inane bullshit that constitute every day life for most people matters. Fuck small talk."
235,I once accidentally overdosed laxatives.,"This didn't happen today but a few weeks ago. 

Well like the title said. I overdosed on magnesium and Niagara falls came from my arse.

I was drinking with my boyfriend. Guinness to be exact. Renowned and infamous for the ""Guinness shits"". We stayed in and drank a rake of cans. I decided to top it off with a gin. I had been eating something with garlic sauce earlier in the day and get pretty bad heart burn so was drinking milk of magnesia (a bottle of what I thought was heartburn remedy).

See my downfall here.. when I was pregnant I had constipation (how delightful) and would take a lot of it so figured it would help now. So I'm chugging it by the capful which is equal to around two table spoons per drink I had. So just before bed my tummy is rumbling like fuck. But I put it down to pizza and cans. Then before bed I take my final capful. I realise I've taken way too much and THEN decide to read the recommended dose. 

""2 tablespoons for heartburn relief. 8 tablespoons for laxatives"". 

I'm about 15+ tablespoons in. I panic. I laugh. My stomach grumbles but it seems okay. I go to bed and hold in a shit most of the night. As soon as I wake up my stomach is loud. But then i realise its not my stomach.. it's my arse.. it's roaring. Whatever is in there is giving it's call. It's like an active volcano ready to erupt and I HAVE to go now. So I run from my boyfriends bed into the toilet and the heavens open from my anus. Chocolate rain. Torrential downpour. Liquid shit. An everlasting flow that doesn't seem to stop. 15 minutes of it. It was like pissing.. from my ass.

It comes and goes over an hour and then I remember I have work in 5 hours... I laugh through wanting to cry. 3 more glorious hours of the magnesium monsoon before I finally get some diarrhea relief and clog my burning raw arsehole and stop the calls of death from my bowels. It was a long shitty day and a very valuable lesson learned.

Before you take medication.. READ THE FUCKINF LABEL.

TL;DR: I created a magnesium monsoon from my arse because I'm an idiot who doesn't read nor consider dosages."
236,almost used shampoo instead of conditioner,my shampoo and conditioner bottles look the same and i accidentally poured a bunch of shampoo into my hand instead of conditioner. luckily i noticed before i put it on my hair but i had to pour it back into the bottle from my hand which wasn’t very effective. as i was doing it i thought “i should post this to pointless stories”. so i did.
237,My Super Conservative Christian Grandma Pulled a Prank on Me and I laughed.,"I mention her conservative Christian views because it’s very out of character for her to pull a joke at someone’s expense. She’s not super in-your-face about it, but will go on a tirade if you bring it up. The “Prank” was an unintentional consequence of a new faucet she had installed in her sink, but she uses it to get people when they come over to her house. I got up from the chair to go to the bathroom did my business and approached the sink to find a faucet like [this](https://www.build.com/pfister-lg42-yp0/s1221931). I turn on the faucet and the damn thing shot right over the sink and onto my pants, making it look like I had pissed myself. I walked out of the bathroom to find my grandma turned around in her chair laughing at me before I even said a word."
238,shoveled the driveway,"in the winter i feel like i do nothing but sit on my ass, so it's a good thing for my health when there's a serious snowfall.  i've never had a snow-blower and i don't think i want one.  i feel like shoveling could become almost a traditional, ancestral practice some day and i want in on that.  the weather here recently has been all over the place and mostly way too warm for this time of year.  today we got a cold snap, though, and some ice-crystal hybrid snowfall.  it sucked.  it was so solid and dense i didn't even sink down into it an inch and i'm heavy.  took a while to develop a method for dealing with it but i just kept chipping through.  i think if i hadn't gotten to it when i did, it would be pure ice by now and impossible to shovel."
239,Boy have I got a story for you,"I just passed by a pigeon and it cood at me and I replied ""Fucking shit birds, randy"""
240,That one time my sister got kicked out of church,"Idfk what this is called but you know how when you’re doing your first communion or that thing after the first communion you have to go to classes on sundays for like 5 weeks then they charge you a ridiculous amount of money for em etc.. 

Well, my sister got kicked out from that.. why you might be asking? It was for the funniest reason, you see, my sister, my older brother and I aren’t religious at all and my sister and I are both bisexual hence even less fans of religion. 

Well, brother and I got together and told sister to ask shit like “why is it bad for 2 females to kiss?” “If god loves everyone why are homosexuals going to hell?” And oh fucking god my favorite one was, “if priests and bishops are chosen by god does that mean that the children they rape are also chosen by god to be raped?” Etc. Well, on the second class they pulled her out and “talked” to her... and my parents. During the next class they booted her out. The reason they stated? “The other kids are trying to learn and she’s distracting them” LMFAO and dude the teacher gave the stupidest answers lmfao for the 2 girls kissing thing she was like “if you ONLY Kiss then you’re not going to tell but anything other than that yes” lmfao dude 

Oh and parents were pissed af because she got kicked out but since they forced all of us to go into those classes we would always ask our parents those questions and they’d be like “when you go you can ask the teacher” so sister took em up on that offer"
241,A man agrees there are a lot of dogs out tonight,"I pull up into the Weis parking lot. I get out of the car and a dog in a huge Escalade starts barking at me like my face is made out of alligator mouths. He is a brown basset hound or something similar. I walk away from my car toward the store and to my left is the silver Honda Element. There is a fluffy white dog poking his head out of it’s window that I think is only a few steps away chemically from a pile of whipped cream- it’s the kind of thing that you can’t help but smile at. It was gentle and fragile and curious. I wanted to pick it up and kiss it, but, of course, that would be absurd. On the bench under the overhang is a man sitting there wearing a very red shirt. I thought it was a Weis employee. As I passed him and opened my mouth to speak I realized he was actually a random pedestrian with neck tattoos but I carry on anyways: “A lot of dogs out tonight huh?” he turned his head toward the parking lot from the position it had been before, which was away from me as he misinterpreted my approach as a primal challenge that males often commence with their eyes- “...Yeh...” he says. I laugh because the whole situation is silly and his reaction so stereotypical. I go inside and buy beer, tater tots, whoopi pies, and plastic bags. The pile of whipped cream is still in the Honda, alone, when I come back out."
242,I did nothing today,
243,Kicked out of the bus," I used a dirty ticket I found on the ground to get on the bus. The driver lets me in but then it had to happen. There's this guy that gets on the bus at random times and checks everyone has a ticket. He got mad and started acting fucking nuts because the ticket was dirty. I told him that the driver let me in and he responded ""I don't care I'm in charge here not the driver"" with a very bad attitude and I went mad. I just wanted to punch him in the face but he basically kicked me out. I got a new ticket and got on the same bus looking him dead in the eyes. It's not like I cheated, I just didn't buy it. Someone else did. He would get paid less if I had used this ticket? Calm the fuck down!"
244,I WAS HAVING A GOOD DAY!,"AND THEN I GOT RICKROLLED BY A RESTAURANT! A RESTAURANT!

now my day is ruined."
245,Ball Over the Fence,"On my lunch break I took a stroll down the street.    
Across the road kids were playing ball on their recess.    
An accidental kick sent it flying.       
The kids eyed the ball longingly on the sidewalk    
I crossed over, looking both ways    
By the time I got there, a passerby had picked it up and threw it    
I stood there awkwardly, out of place    
feeling like I did something wrong."
246,didn't buy enough groceries,"last week i only spent fifty dollars on groceries.  i usually spend more but it seemed like enough at the time.  i try to only shop once a week and the food did last long enough to cover me but barely.  by the end of the week, which was yesterday, all i had left was a bunch of soup and unripe pears.  i mean, i still had stuff in the pantry like rice and flour and potatoes and all good staple/desperation foods but nothing good.  

for dinner my mom was cooking 'coq au vin' and i was so jealous.  since i live at home, i've made it a point to always cook for myself and do my own shopping so even if she'd offered me some i wouldn't have had any, though.  i wasn't planning on getting groceries until the next day but the smell of my mom's cooking pushed me over the edge.  i drafted a quick grocery list and went shopping.  this week i spent seventy dollars which is typical for me.  today i cooked all day and am now very content and full of good food and will be all week."
247,"The current temperature for late at night, the middle of winter in New York is 63°","Yet people still say “this is normal” & “this isn’t global warming” lol bro. New Year’s Eve in New York is one of the coldest days, yet it was like 35. We have a few days of really warm tee-shirt weather this week, but we have until Martin Luther King day to determine this unusual weather. that’s another holiday that’s meant to be really cold & snow on the ground"
248,Too many tumblers,"Starbucks just sucks my cabinet space by making so many tumblers.  Sad thing is.....I'm not the one buying it for me. (Looks at crazed family.....like, there are other things I like besides Starbucks people.....)"
249,My Chromebook Charger,also charges my cellphone. Pretty nifty if you ask me. Now if it would stop snowing and my feet would warm up.
250,"I added creamer to my apple cider at work and it curdled, now I don’t want to drink it but there’s nowhere to dump it out.",The only sink would be in the public restrooms and all my coworkers would see me carrying it into the bathroom.
251,Lake tornados?,"I was just at a gas station and the guy ahead of me was talking to the cashier about how we’re supposed to get really bad weather tomorrow. The guy in line responded “It’s not like we’ll get any tornados or anything, there’s no big lakes around here” super confidently

I’m desperately trying to reconstruct the though process that leads someone to believe lakes are a requirement to have a tornado.  Like, I could understand someone not knowing what causes them, but what in the world makes you think lakes do? And the cashier responded “oh pressure differences cause them we could still get one” without a pause or anything like it was just a normal thing to hear. 

The entire interaction is fucking with my head so hard."
252,My dog is making me sleep on the couch.,"Over Christmas when I was at my homeplace my mum and I had a disagreement so I ended up crashing at my grandparents for the rest of the holidays. With my dog. My dog was used to my mum's place but there's a little more people traffic at my nan's. Plus it's only now that she's properly been allowed inside (my grandparents don't believe in keeping animals inside, I think they made the exception because they felt bad that my dog and I had nowhere else to go. My own house is two hours away.) So basically she's out of her comfort zone.

Welp, I sleep in the spare bed upstairs but no way josé is my dog allowed upstairs. As soon as bed time came, after I tucked her in and said goodnight, she would run up the stairs looking for me, noisily. Consistently. So I put her bed in the back hallway. She barked and barked (she's normally a very quiet girl) and whilst I couldn't hear her, my granda and my cousin's rooms were right next door so that wasn't an option. On the spot I couldn't think of anything to do other than sleep on the couch next to her bed in the living room. I did this for a whole week while I had a perfectly good bed upstairs but whatever, my back was sore but she was quiet and happy and my grandparents hadn't lost it about the fact that there was a noisy dog in their house! 

Fast forward to today, I'm visiting home again. We went for a 5k walk earlier so I figured she'd be too tired to bother chasing me around the house. Tucked her in, said goodnight and went upstairs to bed. After about 10 minutes I hear the familiar pitter-patter of her nails on the wooden floor outside my room. Back downstairs, tucked in, goodnight, only this time I made a barricade at the end of the stairs. 

I'm now waiting for her to either break through the barricade, or go to sleeps in her own bed next to the fire in the living room. Is this what being a parent is like?"
253,My dog is just so flippin adorable,Like she was sleeping next to me on one of her favorite blankets and I’m chilling next to her in a less comfy blanket. As soon as she wakes up she came and sat on my lap and laid her head on my chest and my heart just melted
254,A collection of stories,"Story 1: My kitten, Gerald, has big ears and big eyes. When he shakes his head, his ears flap loudly and it's hilarious. His eyes are even funnier, they are just so comically large. He uses his cute eyes to convince me to cuddle with him. Today, he waltzed into the kitchen and rubbed all over my legs and when I knelt down to love him up, he slammed his face into my palm and purred loudly.

Speaking of purring, his purr is really loud. One night, I was in the kitchen when I heard a loud rumbling sound from around the corner. I went to see what it was, and what do you know, it's Gerald! I have no clue why he was purring, I hadn't petted him, though I did sing a song about him and I guess I've called him by name so many times that he caught on and realized that when I said ""Gerald"" I was referring to him. That cat will purr about anything.

Story 2: My lesson horse stepped on my foot. 

I take lessons every Friday and when I was finished, I took him to the barn to untack him and give him his carrots. When I pulled the bag of carrots out, Socks, the horse, stepped forward right on my foot. If I hadn't been wearing my boots and if he had kept most of his weight off it, my entire foot would be broken.

Story 3: I cuddled my foster kittens.

I have 5 foster kittens and their momma. Prancer, the momma, is 2 years old and the babies were 3 weeks old when I got them, now about 10 or 11 weeks old. I made sure to give momma extra cuddles too, because she is going back to the shelter to get spayed and put up for adoption on the 15th.

The kittens are named Dasher, Dancer, Comet, Cupid, and the only girl, Vixen. Vixen is my favorite of the bunch. She's the only floofy kitten as well as the only girl. While I was with the babies, I scooped Vixen up and cradled her and told her that she is my favorite little floofer. Then I grabbed Dasher and told him that he is the most handsome little thing.

The other kittens didn't want to be picked up cause they were busy fighting, so I left them alone."
255,Wrong order at Starbucks,"I went to Starbucks today and ordered a white chocolate mocha frappuccino. When they handed it to me, it was white instead of the typical light brown. Turns out they made a white chocolate mocha cream frappuccino - without coffee. So disappointing."
256,"I spent too long deciding what to have for lunch, and now my lunch break is over. I'm going to have something extra good for dinner tonight.",Burrito or Thai food? A hoagie or dim sum? Greek food or soup and a salad?
257,Today in Earth Science the girl I paired up with introduced herself and asked me what my name was.,We were lab partners for the entirety of last semester.
258,“Pop-Up Ads”,"My dad was at the computer complaining about “all these damn pop-up ads” and when I looked to see what he was talking about, it turned out he was just right-clicking."
259,Deleting my dating apps has greatly improved my self esteem.,"I decided to delete my dating apps, due to feeling so insecure about myself both mentally and physically. I would look at all these people that were available and just felt I was an ugly person and no one would love me, if my hair wasn’t a certain way, I didn’t dress nice enough, or wasn’t as physically appealing as some of the other people. Once I deleted the apps,  I just stopped trying to compare myself so much to other people."
260,"Well, okay then.","Just spent 10 minutes typing up a hilarious story that I wanted to share, then dropped my phone and accidentally pressed the back button trying to catch it. Post, gone. My precious, hilarious memory, never to be heard by you lovely people. Many apologies :)"
261,I Quit My Job!,"After working a miserable office job for the past 6 months, I quit today! I have a new job that I start next week that will give me way more free time to dive into my hobbies. I'm excited and my life is starting to feel like my own again :)"
262,A Dead Fish and Two Packs of Cigarettes,"When I was a sophomore, I rode my bike to and from campus since I didn't own a car. I took a laborious but safe composition of dirt roads to avoid traffic on a highway notorious for traffic incidents. The trip consumed two and half hours of my daily routine, but I loved the slow pace and scenic views.

On my way home one afternoon, I spotted a pack of Marlborough Lights on the road and decided to pick it up. Recently opened, the pack only had a single butt missing. I assumed the owner made a last-ditch effort to quit that day by littering the pack on a drive to where-ever. *Perfect timing,* I thought. Deep into the most isolated road on my trip, I was ready to roll up a joint. However, the newly acquired consumable was a fantastic match for a my favorite crafting item: the spliff.

After igniting my afternoon, I mounted the bike and continued home. Approaching a green-iron bridge that crossed over to the next back-road, I noticed a dead fish in the middle of the opposite lane. Obviously, I stopped to inspect it. It was a bizarre sight. A bass, approximately ten inches in length, which still looked relatively fresh - probably a morning catch. I assumed the fisherman made a last-ditch effort to store it in an open cooler before hitting a pothole, or perhaps - in a state of carelessness - the catch fell from the roof of his vehicle before driving away. Unlike the pack of smokes, I decided not to pick up the fish. Nonetheless, my intrigue grew from the random treasures appearing on my journey.

A few miles later, I came to a hair-pin turn and around the corner - once again - a pack of cigarettes appeared. This time, a sealed pack of Camel Blues. I was fairly baffled and very high at this point. No longer was I in the mood for shallow assumptions. I tossed the Camels into my bag, stashed my bike in a thick patch of firs, and walked down a steep and rocky bank where I perched myself on a large boulder overlooking a river.

Peering down at the ceaseless currents, I thought about the flow of time, the flow of life, and the assortment of things people obtain that flow in and out of their possession. I thought about my trip and the idea of finding ""A dead fish and two packs of cigarettes."" It felt like a song. I wanted to write about it, find a story in it and sing it to the world.

Thirteen years have passed since that trip. I wrote down the title, but never composed a tune. With each passing day, the story grows more sentimental and seemingly less relatable. Yet, whenever I take that route, either by bike or car, I'm splashed with a sense of nostalgia and excitement - wondering if I'll spot another wild set of oddities and treasures.

263,Maytag commercials have given me a new fear,I love the commercials for Maytag with the guys running in place or things like that but now when I look at my washer or dryer I feel like someone is watching me.
264,I regularly cross the street to go to an on campus building so that I can take a shit.,"This has been going on for over a year. I rent a room in an old house across from campus. I also take fat shits.

Relevant sentence no.1 is relevant because my bathroom in my house is kind of disintegrating. The plumbing works (mostly) but the paint on the walls is peeling, everything is covered in a layer of decades of water marks, everything is weirdly laid out. I'm tall so when I sit on the bowl my knees are often inches away from the sink. The toilet roll holder is built into the wall so I have to physically twist my body to get toilet paper. The toilet bowl is also just tiny so my dick, which is average length, touches the edge of the bowl and there are few feelings I hate in the world than my circumcised dick feeling the cold pain of porcelain in the morning. My housemates also incessantly use the bathroom, their morning routines are like 20 minutes long so if I'm not waiting for them so that I can take a shit, they're waiting for me so that they can do whatever the fuck they do.

Relevant sentence no.2 is relevant because it's an old house and the plumbing isn't that great. I'm not sure if it's the healthiest thing for me but as a full time student working multiple jobs, I've condensed my daily meals into two large ones which are 700-1000 calories each just to encourage myself to eat less throughout the day and to save time; one in the morning and one in the evening. As a result I take some pretty fat shits. 90% of toilets are able to handle my shits, this one can't. It often gets clogged, even with the non fat shits that my housemates take.

Across the street is a campus building. It's really new and really nice. My campus has two types of toilet paper in its bathrooms: the literally just short of paper toilet paper they use in almost every building, and then the nice toilet paper they use in buildings with frequent high profile guests/professional conferences. This building is the latter. The stalls are floor to ceiling closed, nobody can peak at me taking my fat shit. The bathroom is cleaned multiple times a day. Everything in it is super modern Scandinavian architecture, the lighting is enough so you can see but dark enough that the mood is nice and low--not to mention its all recessed into the walls and ceiling so it's not direct light. It's water effecient too, so my shitting here is helping save the environment.

I'm planning on living in the same house next year so more likely than not this is going to continue."
265,Water bottle goes on a trip,"Sydney to North America is a lengthy flight, and as I only got 2 hours of sleep in this 40 hour day (yay timezones!), this was much more amusing than it had any right to be. After 12 hours, there's bound to be a thing or two that has fallen to the floor of the aircraft, and this time around, it was a relatively full water bottle. 

Upon landing, from somewhere behind me in economy, this water bottle begins to slide down the aisle (it was a square type of bottle, so the cap was pointed to the front of the plane; it wasn't rolling). As a plane has to slow from a couple hundred miles per hour to not-as-fast, this meant that the bottle would cover a bit of ground. It clears the bumps of the bulkhead, continues to slide for what feels like forever (this was probably about only 10 seconds), well past the divider for business class, stopping just short of the cockpit.

This water bottle just slid half the length of the aircraft in a straight line, which I had quite the chuckle at, though I can't imagine it was actually that funny. Maybe this could be a sample problem for a high school physics class."
266,I feel bad for killing bees but I'm allergic to bee stings.,I live alone and don't want to be found dead from a bee sting so if I'm alone at home I just kill all the bees that I find around me.
267,I'm not going to win the lotto,"At our office Christmas party they gave out Win For Life scratch off tickets.  I scratched it and won $12.25 (I borrowed a quarter to scratch it and then put it in my pocket.)  So I was like, I could buy lunch once, or I could let it ride.  Let's see how far I can take this.  So I got 6 more tickets, and won $30.  Got 15 more and won $12 again.  I looked up the odds; there's a 1 in 8 million chance of hitting the Win For Life.  It's ridiculous to think it will happen, but I can't stop myself from getting excited about it.  I haven't told anyone because I know how dumb it is to be excited.  

Anyway I'm gonna grab the next 6 tickets after work.  I'm not going to win, but I might."
268,My shitty start to the New Year.,"On New Year's Eve, about a couple minutes before the countdown I was binge watching some podcasts and drinking a few beers at home. I'd been doing it from about the evening (like 6 or so) As it got closer to the countdown I had to go to the toilet so I thought ""I'll try and be quick about it so I don't miss it."" Turned out I had to take a huge dump and as I was mid shit the countdown hit zero and I saw in 2020 having a crap."
269,I’m reading Ready Player One,"and I don’t really like it. Like, I’ll finish the book (I’m halfway through) but it feels very neck beard-y. Like the way Wade talks feels kinda like how every “nice guy” views himself. “Well I’m a little overweight but even though I’m only 18 I’ve memorized the entirety of 80s pop culture”."
270,I fell in love with a girl on Reddit,"I’ve been on Tinder for a while. I met some girls, dated some, Had sex with some. I didn’t really want to have sex though, but I didn’t mind to.

I met fun girls, fake girls, hipsters. I loved it, for a while, but I didn’t wanna be in a relationship with them, nor did I want sex.

I said in my bio: I don’t wanna be in a relationship, I don’t want sex; I want a good friend. Sadly, they all wanted more, and when I say all, it was three girls.

I stopped talking to two of them, dated one. I didn’t want to date her, but I didn’t want to lose her either. Half of my relationships went that way; I don’t wanna be in a relationship, but I don’t wanna lose them.

As I always do, I sabotaged myself to get away from her without hurting her. We weren’t in a relationship, and we stopped talking for a week after seeing each other for a month and half.

How did I sabotage myself? I slept with another girl, obviously. I didn’t want to sleep with her, I didn’t find her attractive either. I was drunk, I was high, I was not anywhere near leaving the other girl, didn’t wanna make her sad. It happened.

The other left me, and there I was: alone again.

The third girl was cool, but god damn. Not that I don’t like brazilians, but she’d kiss so hard, and she was into bdsm, as I’m the fastest cummer in the west.

I’m french, by the way, I’m sorry if it’s unclear: I cum really fucking fast, even when being slow, imagine bdsm sex.

I deleted Tinder, came back on my favorite app: Tik Tok. Of course this is a joke, I came on Reddit. I didn’t really know what I wanted, but I posted on some subreddits about meeting people, as potential friends or lovers. Found some people.

Most of them were weirdos, who’d draw dark stuff like dying people. Some were gay dudes who acted like they only wanted to be friends, some were girls who wanted to know more.

And then there was this girl; the last person who contacted me. She said she found me funny, or something.

“dicks are cool, but memes are cooler”. That was the title of the message, coming with:

“I’m not gonna lie. I’m very stoned right now and I’m not sure if cooler is a word, but fuck it dawg, life’s a risk.”

But that wasn’t the end of it. What sparkled my interest was this: “Terrible segway, but what is your favorite movie?”.

Say I’m egocentric, but I was so happy about that question. “My favorite movie would be Frank”

“Frank is one of my favorites too!”

Fuck. I don’t know what happened there but I didn’t think anyone would ever reply something around that. Everyone who I talked about Frank didn’t know about it, or would be like: “Is that the dude with a big head?” I was surprised, positively. And she also saw the documentary about it! What the actual fuck?

I then thought about something. Something really crazy and weird to think about, perhaps, but that was it: she was the one. It doesn’t sound crazy, so here’s the crazy part: I told myself she’d be the one I love, no matter what. No matter how I feel, no matter how she is: She was the one. The one I’d love for the rest of my life.

My only goal, from now on, was to make her happy. Of course life doesn’t work like this, so I didn’t go as planned.

We started talking, exchanged our Snapchat usernames, talked there, sent pictures of whatever we felt like, called each other; We were in love.

It took 42 days and I was with her, in real life. My lazy ass, who quit college 9 times, who works minimum wage in a shitty job at 22, did in a month more than I ever did in my life: get a passport, get plane tickets, get to her.

I flew from Quebec to her state, in the USA. I paid 600 bucks to see someone I didn’t know the month before, but I did it. And what if it was shit? It would still be something I did, inspiration to whatever I want to create in the future, perhaps.

I arrived there. The city was kinda ugly, I felt like someone was gonna stab me at any moment, but I was with the one I love. It felt better than anything, honestly.

Her friends thought I was gonna murder her, my family thought she was catfishing me, but she was who she was: the most beautiful, the cutest, funniest, smartest girl I’ve met. She was a hipster but what can I do about it.

We spent twelve days together. I initially thought I’d need 200 bucks but I probably spent over a thousand, though it was worth it. She’d go to work and I’d stay home with her cat or visit the city, but most likely stay home. I don’t know what the fuck was up with that city, but I felt lazier than I ever felt. We would still go out almost every night, get drunk and get high.

We had ups and ups only. It was perfect. I can admit I never liked drugs, and I still didn’t like them there, but being with her was perfect. You can tell it’s perfect when the thing I liked the least was a Youtuber, going by the name of L.A. Beast if anyone’s curious.

I came back to Quebec, and life became shit, for some days at least. It became painful. I didn’t know what. I’ve never felt anxious or depressed, but there was an odd feeling in my body. I even guessed it could be the weed that made me feel anxious, since I wouldn’t smoke before and I stopped smoking after. I thought “if weed makes you less anxious, maybe smoking some makes you feel anxious when you’re not smoking anymore”. Shitty english there, hope you understand. That’s the kind of thing an future addict would think, but I didn’t want to smoke; I wanted to feel good.

My last guess, and the one I stick with today, is that I’m emotionally dependent, to her. I’ve never been, but not being about to touch her, hug her, kiss her; it felt like shit.

The first night alone was so bad, I wake up and felt like shit. For some reason I was also behaving like shit, even with her. Not in a shit shit way, but rather in a “Sorry if I’m boring, I don’t feel very good” way.

Even if to this day, I miss the “real” her terribly, That weird feeling later passed. I also got sick during that time, even if I’m never sick. It was Christmas time too, what a time to be sick. I think god was trying to send me a message or something, but I completely misheard it, as I continued on loving her, even harder.

I came back on the 23rd of December, and on the 28th, she sent me a picture: she booked a flight to Quebec. I couldn’t believe it: someone liked me so much they were coming to see me.

She’s coming at the end of February, and I can’t wait for her to be here. I will try to find amazing stuff to show her, hopefully she likes it.

All my life I thought I’ve experienced being in love, but I’ve never been, until recently.

And it feels so good!"
271,The best driving road.,"I was on a Los Angeles to Seattle roadtrip in October. Just me and my car. I was coming home early October [when I saw a beautiful rest stop.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Randolph+E.+Collier+Northbound+and+Southbound+Rest+Area/@41.8529827,-122.5741215,842m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x54ce515f39be6b7f:0x775424fa9709aa63!8m2!3d41.8529787!4d-122.5719328?hl=en) 

I remember I drove down one more exit, got off, and headed northbound towards the the stop. However, here's where my memory get's a little fuzzy. I remember making a hard right onto a road that followed the Klamath river for several miles.

The road intersected train tracks a few times, and there was some industrial buildings. I was less than 30 feet away from the Klamath river for miles, taking turns beautifully through their apex. I was flat out. At the top of 3rd gear in my old Mercedes, flying down the road which was empty, but full of signs of civilization. Beautiful autumn leaves, changing colors. There was a boat/ferry, which was surprising considering how small the river is. I just remember how at ease I was, and how amazing the road was to drive. Easily one of the best roads I drove on that trip.

 I pulled over and took [some pictures](https://imgur.com/a/X3J6EjR) of my car (It was the one year anniversary of ownership) but here's where the issues lies, my memory doesn't correspond to the google maps! I stopped a few miles down the road, took some pics, then headed back to that rest stop.I took [this video](https://imgur.com/a/uvt6mY5) and sent it to my Dad. You can clearly see the road across the river, I had just driven. And apparently Google didn't log that minor detour. I remember seeing a cafe, and it was closed. The only reason I am typing this up, is so that I go explore the area again, and find the cafe."
272,Yesterday I took home Mr. Mouse a.k.a m&m!,[Here he is!](https://imgur.com/gallery/gVvlmNs)
273,I ruined my cousins LEGO figurine,A  long long time ago when I was a kid I was at my cousin’s house and I was playing with her LEGOs and I took one of the LEGO figurines out to the backyard and I left it somewhere in the grass and my uncle ran it over with the lawn mower when he was mowing the lawn and it destroyed my cousin’s LEGO figurine it was the best day of my life
274,gave my dog a vaseline sandwich,"disclaimer: *a fully licensed, totally legit veterinarian told me to.  talk to your vet before using any home remedy on your pet.*  

the family dog ate a bag full of poop a few days ago because she's a filthy animal.  the poop eating we've come to accept but we were worried about the bag getting stuck in her intestines.  we waited it out for a while but after three days the bag still wasn't showing up in her bms so we called the vet to make an appointment.  the vet told us that if the bag were still in her works, giving her a vaseline sandwich would help clear it out just by lubricating her guts.

according to the vet, the recommended dosage of vaseline is a tablespoon per ten pounds of dog.  five tablespoons of vaseline is a lot, and then we had to mix it with enough peanut butter to make it appealing.  when we spread it out on a piece of bread, it was like two inches thick.  we cut the bread into portions, thinking there was no way the dog could eat it all at once.  one slice quickly became four and in a matter of minutes the dog had polished off the whole thing.

we still took her to the vet for an x-ray and it's all good.  they said the bag had already passed and we'd just missed it.  

as to the effects of the vaseline, the less said the better."
275,I just watched Aquaman. I hated it.,"I am not into the superhero stuff but Jason mamoa is hard to pass up. But I was sorely disappointed by the special effects, the cliche, the story, the romance, the conflict, the dialogue..."
276,Story about camping,"
I'm very young and can't sleep, I get out of the tent and wander around in complete black void darkness. Nothing but the crunch of pine needles and loose earth under my boots. I catch a little pinpoint red light burning its way through the veil and start off in that direction

I get closer and closer and the light seems to pulsate, glowing and dimming and glowing again, and when I get near enough I can smell tobacco smoke and catch my uncles face illuminated for a second, rough and full of wrinkles and a thick gray beard, and the glow dies out again

I sit across from him, dead weeds breaking and pebbles screeching against each other as I do, and we sit like that for a bit, his cigarette still living and dying with each pull, and when it dies and doesn't revive he says, voice decayed and rusty and drawn out from a lack of sleep and thin freezing mountain air, 

Do you hear that?

I listen close, trying my best to find some sound in the isolation

No.

Just wait, it'll happen again. It's like the ocean.

I wait and wait, ears perked and alert, and soon I hear it. It's slow at first, then it builds low and rumbling and massive, then I hear rustling and crashing, some huge force tearing through thousands of unmoving things, like one incredible wave starting and falling miles away.

I say into the black,

What is it?

He says,

It's the wind. It comes through the valley down there, goes through the trees. That's all you can hear when you're up this early. God's show of strength. 

I sit in the dark and he sits somewhere across from me in the dark too and we listen to the wave tear through the through the valley. Eventually he lights another cigarette and I go back to the tent."
277,I don't like the taste of toothpaste and then almost split my head open in the shower,"I swear it'll come together and make sense. Bare with me. Lol.

So, it's not that I don't like the flavor. It's just got something to do with something like a conditioned taste aversion. I've evidently failed to rinse my mouth out enough a few times and ended up swallowing some of the toothpaste (not on purpose), ending up with acute fluoride poisoning. Basically, you get a nasty case of the shits if you ingest too much fluoride at once, and then you're fine. And I guess I now associate the taste of the toothpaste with a nasty case of the shits.

So, I brushed my teeth before my nightly shower and shit, and as I was sitting on the porcelain throne, I was spitting into the shower/tub 'cause I wasn't satisfied with how rinsed out my mouth was while browsing Reddit, as one does. I won't say it's OCD 'cause it's not been diagnosed and would probably be silly to call it that, and it's not really a big deal (although it hasn't always gone unnoticed).

When I was done poopin' and scrollin', I hopped into the shower (before turning the water and overhead shower on and soaking myself to more easily regulate the temperature) and almost slipped in the stream of saliva that had accumulated. Thankfully, I caught my balance and rinsed the river down the drain as if nothing had happened.

I decided it might be better to brush my teeth right before my shower this time."
278,I’m making it happen,"I signed up for my first dance class today. I’ve always wanted to learn how to dance but I’ve always been afraid and embarrassed of myself. Sometimes I’m still sad but I know I have to fill my days with things other than thoughts of what used to be. I’m meeting friends for dinner tomorrow, looking into yoga classes, and I’m going out this weekend. Even though I’m proud of myself for the little things I’m doing for me, it’s really fucking hard still. Maybe it’s dumb writing these internet posts but it makes me feel better knowing I can get it out there. I’m hoping that everyone else who’s struggling will find a new will to live because I’m honestly looking for more of you guys. I want us to all grow together and get through shit because we can."
279,I ruined a group selfie,"I was walking out of an ice cream shop with an ice cream cone and saw a gaggle of girls outside with their fresh cones looking super excited and laughing. One of them whipped out their phones taking a selfie with about 4 others in the frame.  
I interrupted to ask if they wanted me to take it.

The girl said no and when they resumed they didn't have the same happy energy they had in that moment."
280,Got complimented on my hairdo today.,Usually I wear a hat to work but decided not to today. Confidence boosted.
281,Funny drunk story...,"So I was out with my friends and we got like really  drunk. While we were at the bar(before leaving) I was telling to each of my friends we need to go to the bakery(the only thing that works 24/7 where you can get food) and grab something to eat. They all agreed. When we left the bar I was telling to them you MUST get this kind of pizza(i dont know how to call it in english) because its really really good, and I was telling this to them on all the way to the bakery. When we arrived there, there was some guy infront of me who was thinking what should I get, this or that, or that... and I'm like yoo broo get that pizza because its really really good you wont regret it.. and hes like nahh man idk.. and Im like no man come on get it, and then I told to the employee there, here is the money, give this dude that pizza, and then I got one for myself and went outside... after 2 3 mins, the guy that was infront of me, comes to me and says: yoo bro, you have really good heart, and I will give to you anything you want, and then he handed to me a huge amonut of cash.. he said: here broo take how much you want I have about $18k in here... then I saw him and I'm like: nahh broo, if you have some weed that would be great.. then he reached to his pocked and handed me like 2grams of weed... (that was one of the best weeds I've ever tried)
Next morning when I woke up, my first thought was ... damn man did the guy really handed me $18k and told me take how much you want, and I only took his 2g of weed!!! Then my friends confirmed this... 
I'm still thankful to that guy for the weed tho'"
282,Suddenly my whole life is different,"It's nearly 1am and I have school tomorrow, but I've just discovered that I can speed up audio books and listen to them that way. I just listened to the book The War of Art and it was totally eye opening and I feel like a completely different person suddenly... I need to read more, I just need to find the money lol."
283,"In the last 4 bathrooms I’ve used, I’ve been the person to use the last of the toilet paper.",
284,Need to sweat,"I'm cancelling my gym membership and switching to a new one that offers classes (yoga, spin, circuit etc.) So I can stop making excuses and lose some lbs. !"
285,I ate crispy onions today,I love onions. I bought a container of those french's fried onions to make something for dinner but I ate them all instead. It only took one night.
286,I think I'm losing my mind.,"Just spent about 10 minutes walking around my apartment, looking for a cup of coffee I *KNOW* I poured. I finally found my empty cup, rinsed out, in the sink. I have no memory of drinking my coffee, or rinsing out my cup. Either I'm losing my mind, or there's ghosts afoot."
287,Senior successfully uses USPS automated kiosk,"Today I went to my local post office to mail a package. As any USPS customer knows, USPS customer service providers will remind you of how you could have used the automated kiosk to receive the service you just utilized. The line for human customer service was quite long on this particular day, snaking around the too-small post office lobby.  With my brain echoing ""don't forget you can use the automated kiosk!"", I queued behind an elderly woman using said kiosk.

Oxygen tubes peeked from a messenger bag, running along the soft, stout woman's left side. ""No, my package does not contain any of those items,"" she said in a sweet, high-pitched voice as she pressed the appropriate button. The woman proceeded to read each prompt out loud as if the kiosk were talking. She replied out loud to the kiosk before touching each button. When finished, the woman hurray-ed in delight. She slowly turned to face me with the assistance of her quad base cane. The woman looked at me with a huge smile, exclaiming ""I did it! I beat the machine! I did it!"" I smiled back and said something friendly in return that I cannot recall.

It was nice to witness a stranger finding joy in their accomplishment. 

P.S. Not all elderly folks are technologically incompetent. If you have not used the automated kiosk, note that some of the screen prompts are confusing. It is hard not to stumble while using it!"
288,Had a rockstar moment and sang my guts out,"I was blasting music on my speaker and singing along for like 4 hours straight while doing housework this morning. Toward the end of my concert for my neighbors I was singing along to ""In a Darkened Room"" by Skid Row and really getting into it. At the end of the last chorus (on the studio version) there's a super long, powerful phrase that Bach belts out. I hit that pretty ON POINT and threw up. I think it was a mix of crying because that song is really emotional & meaningful to me and because I destroyed my lungs/stomach singing at max volume, but I just doubled over and borfed on the carpet. I felt pretty cool though!"
289,It's 2am and I just remembered,In my junior year of high school I got my entire friend group hooked on Heathers the Musical by showing them a really cool animatic of Meant to be Yours. Time to stay up another hour rewatching and reminiscing
290,Parting my hair differently,"I’ve gone my whole life with my hair parted in the same direction. However, today I was bored and combed it to the other side. I can believe how much better it looks!"
291,I have a strong gut feeling about my new manager.,"My new manager started today, I've had an off feeling about her since she first walked in for the interview. I had this same feeling with our last new hire and I was completely correct about him. Everyone loved him the first few weeks until he started pulling sketchy shit. I knew it wouldn't last, and never gave into his bullshit. Bad vibes from the start. I knew it. 

The new hire who started today is giving me a similar vibe. Can't tell my boss I told you so, so when it goes to shit with the newest hire, I'll be able to tell Reddit."
292,I snacked like a fat fuck at work today,"For a lot of people in my office, today was the first day back from holiday vacations. There's a communal ""snack section"" in our office where people bring free treatz, and a few people brought some today.

The first thing that was up was a big ol' basket of fruit. There was one pomegranate in there, and I took back to my cube for later snacking.

Then shortly after there was a woman cutting up a delicious loaf of freshly-baked banana bread. I had two slices of it because it was hella bomb.

A handful of almonds was consumed somewhere around this point during a meeting. I keep them in my drawer.

Soon I went to lunch (Costco hot dog and pepperoni pizza slice). Not a snack, I know, but this leads me to the next part...

After lunch I noticed that there was still a little bit trail mix left in this giant bag someone brought before the break. I picked up the entire bag and poured the rest of it it into my fat mouth. Two people saw me do it and laughed at me, but the jokes on them because I won the trail mix. Idiots.

Then there was a dude at my work who got married over the break. He brought in leftover La Croixs from his wedding and I took one of them low-calorie bitches for myself because I wanted to be healthy.

Someone left the last piece of banana bread. The heel of the loaf. I fucking ate that too.

Then after everyone was gone, I took the last La Croix home.

After I got home, I heated up two bowls of (vegan) pumpkin chili and got down.

Now I'm eating a pomegranate and drinking this cran-raspberry La Croix. 

The end"
293,Sneeze injury,I sneezed while driving to work yesterday and injured my tailbone. It’s been hurting ever since.
294,Lib balm + jeans pocket + washing machine + dryer = still works great,Burt's Bees mango flavored. Mmmmm.
295,I saw an ad for the air force on here and thought wtf?,"Why would the air force ever need to do advertisement? I mean who would ever see that and think,"" The... US... air...force...? What? What is this? Why is this the first time I'm hearing of this? Well shit, sign me up."""
296,"One of the first times I got high, I organized my embroidery thread by “feelings” than by color.","I still have it that way. So one clump is “happy”, or “somber” etc. just however those color combos made me feel at the time."
297,For the first time in my life I made it an entire winter without seeing snow.,"I’m from New York but I’m going to school in South Carolina which is wonderfully warm. 

Winter recess is ending so I’m flying back now. Thankfully, the month I spent at home was free of snow (and shoveling)  I know winter isn’t over yet, but I don’t think it’s going to snow down there in the next couple of months. 

Also, my mom texted me, and it started snowing in New York about 10 minutes after my plane took off."
298,I got a two minute “Mug Cake” for Christmas and I don’t want it,"My friend’s roommate got me an oversized mug which includes cake mix so you can use a microwave to bake a cake in it in two minutes. I need an egg and milk to make it work, and I don’t have either of those. I also don’t own a microwave. I hate getting mugs as a gift. I have too many. It also came with a Ghirardelli chocolate square that I took out of the package and ate. That was the only thing I liked about it.

It came from www.moderngourmetfoods.com apparently. And the image uploaded sideways for some reason.

299,Walking to the store/invited to drug dealers house,"&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Deep bass and thin little high hats blare in the next room over as I sit typing this. They think I'm sleeping but I haven't slept in something like three days

&#x200B;

I guess I'll write about my trip to the store last night

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I stepped out from the lobby of my building, it was filled with poorly hung wreathes and paper santas and drowned annoying in amounts of saccharine and warm light

&#x200B;

I stumbled into what to me seemed like endless possibilities for harm

&#x200B;

The desert was starting to show the other half of its dichotomy now and in between breathes I caught a thin little mass of steam collected in front of me

&#x200B;

Im walking, hoping to reach the store before closing

&#x200B;

There was a surprising amount people out considering the lateness, and they were performing an endless number of memorized actions:

&#x200B;

Holding hands with a loved one

&#x200B;

Laughing at a bad joke told by a peer

&#x200B;

Drinking out of brown bags with wet spots all along them

&#x200B;

Inhaling, exhaling smoke

&#x200B;

As I observed I realized my entire face was numb and I had a sudden urge to gag

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

""Hey man, what are you up to?""

&#x200B;

This frail chain-smoking voice seemed to come from the direct left of me though when I jerked my head in a quick, possibly unnatural motion I was faced only with distant lights and a football field across campus and, when I really focused, the low rushing dots of airplanes

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A bit further down the sidewalk, passing walls and walls of dorm windows covered in electric neon christmas lights and laughter escaping from cracked doors, I reached the circle, dotted with cars and lampposts

&#x200B;

Mid cross, a series of low booms trapped in a barrel caught my ear and I turned to face the apex predator of the american roadway

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Its muscles contorted into performance by flammable liquid and tiny explosions

&#x200B;

Its eyes emitting fluorescent beams

&#x200B;

After the initial daze, I realized I recognized this truck, and it was crawling up beside me

&#x200B;

A silhouette I didn't recognize forced its head out the passenger window

&#x200B;

""Hey man, what are you up to? We're heading over to Johns place.""

It caught a passing light for a second and I take in as many features as possible, curly dark hair, perfect neon teeth framed in a smile, low eyes and small pinpoint pupils, hand holding a cylinder of packed weed burning red at one end

&#x200B;

Have I met this person before?

&#x200B;

I don't really want to go to Johns place, I don't have the money for it, I need to sleep, I need to eat, my body is breaking down

&#x200B;

""Yeah I'll go.""

&#x200B;

He hands me the joint as climb into vehicle, three more faces I can't make out in the darkness

&#x200B;

One of them passes me a little white rectangular object, I turn it over in my fingers

&#x200B;

Its split up into four sections, a passive warning to use in moderation, but I pop the whole thing in my mouth anyway, chew it and recognize the bitter taste that I've come to really enjoy

&#x200B;

After this I take an inhale from the joint, I can't feel the smoke go down my throat.

&#x200B;

Exhale and the smoke fills the cab, catching every little orange beam coming from the doors or the roof of the thing or from under the rearview mirror

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Whoever I'm with turns to me and whispers, ""I fucking hate these guys too, but shit, at least you're not in a cab right?""

&#x200B;

He laughs and my head is hazy and I'm not sure if this is even the one I've met before or not

&#x200B;

And now the guy driving is talking to John on speaker, he tells him we'll be there in about twenty minutes

&#x200B;

And I kind of think about opening the door and jumping into the river of asphalt that's flowing under us"
300,Something embarrassing happened today,"I don't wish to say what happened while it's still so fresh in my mind, but I do want to say that I fucking hate myself for being so fucking stupid and now I wanna fuckin die. I hate that my brain is wired to be embarrassed about such small things. I know nobody gives a shit, but I can't stop caring so much."
301,I told an story to my coworkers as I was high,"Some days ago, there was a blackout on the factory I work in.
All my area was in the office first discussing about the Flat Earth Theory™️ and then others conspiracies.
The ""boss"" said: ""How can we know dinosaurs existed if we weren't alive on that era?"", Then I answered: ""I was""
- You couldn't, you're 18
- That's because I'm a time traveller
- So you went to that time?
- No, I was alive at that time but the meteorite that killed the dinosaurs gave me powers Bruce Banner style

I kept the tale for fourty minutes and at the end I was:
- 475 years old 
- An Atlantis citizen
- Born in China with the East India British Company on 1870
- Part of the Xhosa

Then my supervisor called me and finished my story :'3"
302,"I was told to download the Robinhood app years ago, but downloaded myRobinhood instead.","It didn’t have many users on it and I won $100 off of it in the daily drawings (it had a drawing every day, I’d win $10 every other day) as well as a bunch of free items.

I told my friend about it and he also started winning money on it.

Then a couple weeks after, the app stopped working. It added some wheel you had to spin and it would just keep spinning.

Then the app disappeared.

I can’t find any information about it online - it’s almost like it didn’t even exist.

It had a website, but it has nothing on it now.

I don’t know how it gave away so much money or free stuff because I don’t remember any ads.

I’ve been searching for information about it for years, but I’ve found nothing."
303,A year ago I almost adopted a degu. Adoption centre said I needed to adopt his brother too. My landlady only allows one pet at a time so I bought a toy penguin instead and he lives in my fridge.,"UPDATE: [Pics of my penguin Aidan on holiday with me in Lincolnshire (UK)](https://imgur.com/gallery/WGInNs9)

UPDATE 2: [More photos of Aidan on holiday; in Brighton (UK)!](https://imgur.com/gallery/GO3g7m4)

That’s the upside down house. It would work better with a real penguin or a human being as some of these photos look like I’ve just glued him into position so they’re not as jaw-dropping. But! He enjoyed scaling the ceiling so I’m happy.

UPDATE 3: Sorry folks! Forgot to mention that Aidan the toy penguin actually came with a monthly donation I make to WWF to sponsor a real penguin. So technically he was bought-adopted."
304,"I cried at 12th grade, because my headmaster kissed me on my forehead","For the record, i'm a female and so is my headmaster, so nothing weird happened. It's just that, my parents always busy working, left me and my sis alone at the house. Maybe i'm the one who doesn't remember if my parents ever showed affection (we don't express our love by hug and kisses).

That one time, after my class' performance about teachers (we're in our final year, and expressing our gratitude), my headmaster kissed me on my forehead. Something about that simple kiss on the forehead got me crying."
305,I sewed a tiny Tux,"He is cute. My mom likes him, so I am going to install puppy linux on her computer.

306,I was walking at night with my friends during the 1st January and I saw a bin on fire.,I love Italy
307,One time...,I forgot to do homework and got in trouble :(
308,i think this is bad,"i went over to my friends house last night (it’s currently 5am) after getting margaritas with dinner. her boyfriend came and got us and the 3 of us went back to his apartment to keep drinking/play games/hang out. at one point they mentioned making a sex tape but how it was boring bc there was no camera movement. they said they brought me over to get me drunk enough to where i’d record one for them. i jokingly said i would but then the moment passed. kept playing card games and drinking. all the sudden, girl hands me her phone and says “record this” and starts full on having sex with her boyfriend right in front of me. at first i’m recording them, just holding up the phone and looking the other way, then it gets louder and grosser and i just can’t stand it. text my boyfriend super upset and tell him i want to leave. he tells me i definitely should. i stop the video, get up and try to find my keys and realize her boyfriend hid them from me. so i go sit in his room. crying cause i wanna go home and i feel like i’ve been violated somehow? they both get dressed and get mad AS FUCK at me for trying to leave. then try to laugh the whole thing off. i say not funny, give me my keys, i’m leaving. they say no. i threaten to flip the coffee table. they say no. i flip the coffee table. he finally throws my keys by the door and calls at me like a dog. they’re screaming back and forth about “are you really just gonna let her kill herself by driving home” etc. i take my keys, call my boyfriend in hysterics, and go get in my car. as i’m about to leave she opens my driver side door and is screaming at me about how she doesn’t care how upset i am at them that i can’t drive cause i’ll kill myself. she tries to get in my lap in the drivers seat to stop me and i push her out and throw the car in reverse (side note: i was 5min from home and absolutely wouldn’t have driven if i couldn’t but i needed to get the fuck out of there). i make it home and immediately block them both on everything. still in hysterics at this point, declining calls from both of them while trying to block their numbers, trying to figure out how to get my stuff back, trying to convince my boyfriend he doesn’t need to drive 2 hours in the middle of the night to come take care of me. the last thing i remember is my best friend from home calling me and me sobbing saying i wanted to go home (i recently moved 4 hours away). 

i literally do not know what to do about this. it’s 5am right now and i can’t sleep because the guy choked me so hard with his forearm that it hurts to swallow. i feel violated but i also feel like it’s my fault. and i feel like an idiot for driving home. nothing happened but still it’s not safe. i never want to talk to either of them again but she was my closest friend. this isn’t the first time she’s violated one of her friends by doing weird sexual shit around them and they need to know it’s not okay. what the fuck is my life. happy 2020."
309,I got mad because I didn't get a Nintendo switch,I (25f) just got mad because I didn't get a Nintendo switch and I can't buy it myself. I know I am stupid but I needed to share my stupidity with the redditors.
310,This is my first ever reddit post,hello
311,Someone guessed my age to be 48,I'm 38. Now I excuse me while I go cry
312,I think this sub is dumb,"I am posting about how this sub is dumb on this sub, yes that's how dumb this sub is"
313,"I got bored at work, and came up with a name game","**Rules:** You have to come up with chains of names, so a last name is the first name of the next person. You can only use names of celebrities, professional football players, and presidents but NOT fictional characters. The longest one wins.

**Names I came up with:** 

Arron Donald Trump, Benjamin Harrison Ford, Travis Scott Disick, Elton John Tyler Perry, Travis Benjamin Franklin Pierce Morgan Freeman."
314,"I want to clock and walk out of my job, but I probably won't","Kinda wish I could just do the rash thing thing and leave instead of being a responsible worker. (It is only a pizza place, so I don't suppose it matters too much.) I haven't been too well mentally this past little while and I would rather wander into traffic than be here, ya feel me? However, that wouldn't be fair to my boss or the two other people here who fucking suck at their jobs.

I've been searching for a new job for over a month now, something that will probably be more soul-crushing but will at least pay more, but I haven't had the luck. I've gotten endless return emails letting me know that I haven't been accepted for the positions and only just a few interviews that probably won't lead anywhere. I want things to be better, but this is making me miserable.

I can't risk quitting this low-paying job because no one else may hire me. I can't leave right now even though I want to cry because no one else fucking knows how to close up the damn shop."
315,I cursed in front of my parents for the first time today,"They think I’m some sort of goody two shoes, which I kinda am for the most part (in-person), but I muttered “fuck” today after I got shot in a game.  My dad turned around slowly and asked me what I said.  I tried to evade the fact that I did indeed say “fuck.”  

Embarrassing, yes.  This is why I usually don’t use a headset while gaming, so the loud music masks my “under-the-breath” swearing.  Today I wore a headset, and forgot that there was no masking."
316,I'm itching to decorate cakes,"For about four years as a teenager, I took cake decorating projects in 4H and got really good at it. Eventually I stopped, only because I ran out of the drive to keep up with 4H. This past year, I've been really itching to start decorating cakes again, but I don't have any of the supplies. I added a bunch of things to my cart online and I'm waiting until either next check or the one after to buy them. I don't like cake, so I'm gonna be throwing cakes at my friends, family, and coworkers until I either tire myself out or get good enough to sell them"
317,I deleted my Facebook. I don't have instagram so I just use Reddit and Whatsapp now.,
318,The mom of a friend I haven’t seen or spoken to in about 10 years is drunk calling me right now.,"She has called 3 times, and it’s actually kinda sweet. She keeps asking how me and the girls in our old group are doing...kinda weird considering how long it’s been and how late she is calling while highly intoxicated...also not sure if it’s more impressive that I still have the same phone number or that she still has my number..."
319,My cat has been having nightmares ever since we introduced her to our friend’s cat.,"I was visiting my parents over break and brought my cat with me. Our friend was away on break and left his cat with my parents. After a few days of an introduction process, we allowed the cats to roam around freely around the house. They didn’t fight but they did occasionally hiss as they decreased the space they placed in between them with each interaction. The thing is, my cat as been distraught since she’s met this other boy cat who has the meow of cat who smokes a pack of cigarettes a day. She’s been having nightmares. I can tell because she falls into a deep sleep, one where my petting and tummy rubs don’t even make her purr because she’s KO’d. Then suddenly, she starts growling in her sleep and kicking with one leg. We’re back at my own place away from that other cat now. She was just sleeping but suddenly woke up, jumped, and started hissing. I calmed her down by petting her and she fell back asleep. 

Who knew cats could have nightmares?"
320,A bagel bite just burned the top of my mouth so bad that there is a blister,"I was really hungry so I stuffed half a bagel bite in my mouth. It was far too hot but I was with a group of people so tried to play it cool put her down. My tongue just discovered a blister on the roof of my mouth from it. This has never happened to me before, I hope it doesn't hurt too bad tomorrow"
321,I found coal on the side of a rail road track,"I was going out with this girl a little while ago to this cave that was right on a railroad track, and I had trouble finding it because all I had was the latitude and longitude.

We were walking along the track and I found a fist sized chunk of coal, and was really happy about it.  I remember my dad told me about how my great grandfather used to go out to the railroad tracks to find coal to heat his house, and I was really thrilled about having this lump of soon-to-be atmospheric carbon.

I showed it to the girl I was with and she didn't care for it I guess. Real shame, it would've made a great Christmas present."
322,Where are you from? Do you like your country?,"I am from Brazil and I love it, less the political part."
323,Some old guy in tokyo asked me if i wanted to buy a prostitute once,"&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Walking around Tokyo, massive buildings lit up by the neon nightlife. Some of them have thin translucent shapes of light playing over windows, cartoon mascots and Japanese lettering. There's so many people out despite the lateness, huge herds undulating and moving in seemingly coordinated groups, across streets and through lines of tiny plastic cars or down sidewalks with more grace and style and ease than I thought possible for crowds of that size.

I'm just going around aimlessly trying to get used to the city and I get the feeling like my drunk stupid chaotic movements have no place in a civilization like this, futuristic and expensive and calculated. All the thousands of people that pass me every second give me strange unfamiliar looks, furrowed brows and dark eyes and expressions like maybe I should be dressed in sheen coats and and bright pants like them

It starts to rain, misty droplets ignited through all the crisscrossing beams of headlights and lit hundreds of feet above me, a huge multicolored globe of plasma covering a bustling population

I'm staring up at the sky, dumb and overt and people just keep walking past. Thousands of voices blending into a single aura that reminds me a lot of those chaotic manic whispers you hear at night right before you drift off

Suddenly there's one distinguishable, old and raspy and with broken English,

You want to fuck Japanese girls?

I pull my vision away from the sky and buildings and stare at the man for a bit. A white medical facemask and behind that little crisscrossing intersections of lines and wrinkles, black eyes half hidden by drooping flesh, long white hair poking out of a cap and curling at the ends. He's holding up a transparent umbrella glowing in the light and it's covered with faint streaks of water that gather at the edge

I get out, frantic and riddled with unfounded anxiety,

Sorry, what?

You want to fuck Japanese girls? Only 100.

He says this slow and annoyed, then looks me over and adds

US dollar.

We stand like that for a bit, two rocks sticking up from a creek of people, they pay no mind and continue to snake in between us and roll around our edges, fluid and dedicated to get wherever they're going at two in the morning. Heavy droplets hit my head and I realize the rains picked up and I'm starting to get soaked, so I say, loud so it can break through the roar of the people,

No, thanks though. I'm only 16.

I can see the edges of his face lift behind his mask and his eyes disappear completely under rolls of weathered skin and he mumbles,

It doesn't matter.

I repeat again no thanks I'm fine and the man nods and assimilates into the liquid and floats somewhere down the street, already invisible 

I walk around a bit more despite the weather and return to the room drenched and awake"
324,Factories are mind boggling,So I'm walking around the store today and it's crazy to think that every single product we come across when shopping is most likely made in some factory. That's a lot of products and a lot of factories.
325,"As a kid, I confused Tennessee Williams with Tennessee Ernie Ford","Once I sorted out that they were different people, I was genuinely disappointed. Imagine if the same guy who wrote *A Streetcar Named Desire* had recorded ""Sixteen Tons."" THAT, my friends, would be one hell of an artistic range."
326,One of the best memories I have with my dad,"We were just getting back from a long drive, exhausted out of our minds. I was giddy, practically endorphin-drunk like I always am when I get really tired. We chose to spend the night at my grandpa’s apartment, the apartment he called a “crackerbox” because it was hard to step anywhere in it without cracking elbows with someone. I missed his old house. He’d chosen to move to this place because it would be “more convenient” to the rest of us when he was gone, and that hurt me a bit inside, but I knew it was easier for my grandpa to be away from that house that had haunted him with my grandmother’s spirit for so many years.

Thinking about that just makes me realize how much I love my grandpa for everything he did, and how much I love my dad for everything he does now. My giddy, sleep-deprived self spins in a rolling chair and asks my father to dance. We sway together, my father and I.

“Anything for my daughter,” he says with a smile. I remember thinking I could never love anyone as much as I loved him then.

As we sway, I hum a song with no words, just sweet sounds. The lyrics of the song itself were french, an old Serge Gainsbourg tune, and though I knew it probably meant something dirty it was just sweet to me then.

Dad asks me what song I’m singing.

I say, “I don’t know, it’s in French.” But I kind of feel like I do, like we’ve just made it our own in in our own small way in this crackerjack apartment built for two."
327,Talking with a homeless guy in arizona,"(Trying to write about a story a day cause i like doing it and im trying to improve. If this is spam or not suited for the sub mods please let me know and ill stop posting because spamming would just not be very cash money of me would it)

&#x200B;

It's almost dawn now and I'm heading down the street my head still buzzing and vision vibrating., I pass through the thin orange drapery of streetlight over and over and occasionally a car blaring instruments and packed with drunk and yelling twenty somethings passes me. Up ahead there's a white glow cracking through the dark, and I get up to it and strobing neon letters spell out Quik Stop.

I'm making my way up to the doors and there's some figure off to my left barely catching any of the light, but from what I can see he's homeless. A pockmarked face with patches of white thread poking their way through, lines and divots showing his age, half illuminated eyes pleading at me and one of them cloudy blue. I say,

Can I get you anything?

And he says,

Marlboro reds.

His voice is high pitched and quivering laced with an even mix of surprise and dread like he expects me to go in for a bit and come out with one of those translucent cheap bags and walk right past him back off to wherever I came from trying to avoid his stare as I do.

I get in and pick out multicolored neon bottles and bags, shit food for a shit lifestyle and I get up to the counter and before I pay ask for two packs of Marlboro reds since that's what I smoke too. Out of the store I turn to the man and hand him his cigarettes and he thanks me profusely, over and over and over, and I feel like such a jackass being praised like that. What kind of situation is this person in that one act of humanity coaxes so much thanks out of him. I'm curious and so I say,

No problem

And then pause unsure of how gracefully I'm going to be able to word what I say next, but say anyway,

Hey um, how did you…get out here like this? If I'm an asshole for asking that just let me know and I'll leave.""

He's staring at me weird and his jaw is tightened, frayed brows pinched in a familiar way that tells me my misunderstanding of societal norms has let my idiocy shine through again. But then he gets out,

No, no trouble.

And then I fall down next to him and up close I can make out microscopic details of his appearance- a thick coating of dirt and grease and matting down his hair, most of his teeth missing leaving little pink holes behind and the ones he has all yellowed and dotted with black craters, skin on his face thick and shiny with grease, clinging to bone in a weird way like there's no flesh left to pad it out.

Well, when I was a coal worker in Wyoming. I worked that job from when I was a young man all up until I was fifty two or so.

He talks with a thick lisp and moves his jaw around in twitchy motions as the words come out, expels breath in quick bursts between sentences and it's white in the cold air and thick with the smell of bottom shelf alcohol. He's opening the pack of cigarettes now, tosses aside the cellophane and it catches the current of the wind and is carried off somewhere down the street occasionally blinking as it hits illumination. He puts one into his mouth and strikes a match, flame catching blue at first then the warm glow of yellow and he dips the end of the cigarette in the fire and puffs a few times then takes in a draw, liquid smoke pouring out of his sullen face and sputtering and dissipating in all directions as the air takes it. He puts an arm over his mouth and doubles over, retching and coughing violently, his body shakes and spasms beneath tattered cloth and he spits onto the concrete and wipes his lips.

I never married, always thought that I'd have time for it later on I guess…but I figured I'd need money for that first. Lots of money.

His pupils find mine and his eyes scrunch up as he laughs, sharp cackling, and I laugh too.

But, I got hurt bad at work one day. Some ligament in my leg tore I was told. I didn't work for a while and the company paid me all right while I was off, but when I was about due to head back, they shut down. Coal is a dying business I guess so I wasn't surprised, it just happened quicker than I thought. I was trying to find another job and picking away at my savings but I started to feel some pain in my chest, went to the doctor and they said I got black lung, from the dust from all the coal. That about put me out, I couldn't work or do much at all. Time went on and things went on like that, I was paying all these bills to the hospital and they were trying all these treatments. And there was the medicine. Pretty soon, I got a letter, said my balance was in the negatives.

His eyes are cloudy pink now and liquids gathered at the edges threatening to cut lines through the dirt on his face.

I couldn't do anything, I had no way to pay you know. I lost everything little by little, and I couldn't do anything. Finally they took my home, if you could really call it a home. I made my way out here just finding rides. After that I tried to find work but what can I do? No one will hire a sick man, or a man that looks like this, dresses like this, but I can't help it. I always said I'd figure it out and things would pick up, but then things go on and you can't stop em. Years tick by and I guess God thought it'd be funny to make my whole life go by in a minute. And I thought people would be kinder. Some of them are you know, I don't mean they aren't, but most aren't. People yell things at me, threaten me, kick me. I can't say I really understand why they hate me so much. I guess they're just trained that way now. By what I can't say.

I light a cigarette and pull in the smoke then let it out, tell him I'm sorry and he says god bless and I leave."
328,I found a freemason's ID/membership card today,"While cleaning the parking lot of an office building this afternoon, I found a small card in the parking lot- I thought it was a business card.

When I picked it up, I found the name, member number, lodge number, etc. of a freemason. I asked someone who was entering the building whose lot I was cleaning if there was a reception desk where I could turn in the card, but not only was there no receptionist in that building- the mason worked in the adjacent building, to which is attached a fair bit of superstition (I'll give you a hint as to the name- the building shares a name with a man who lived at Boleskine House.)

I turned the card in to the receptionist, who was very nice. She asked if I wanted to leave my name to tell the mason who found the card, but when she saw that I'd frozen at the question she just smiled slightly and said she could just give him the card without my name. I smiled in relief and said that would be fine, and wished her a good day as I left."
329,"When I was a kid, I thought all Moms and Dads had my parents' first names",
330,I love the feeling of squeezing my pimples and I just can't stop,"I've had pimples since middle school, and I absolutely love popping them. It's bad for my skin, I know, but I just love the feeling of squeezing them out. the sensation on my fingers when a black head slowly pops out, or that *zoot!* sound when a big zit jet sprays on the mirror. ugh. so satisfying. I think I'm using it to cope stress sometimes. Unhealthy, but it just feels really good. I probably should stop doing this, but I just can't. Maybe I'm addicted."
331,I have goals now,"2020 is gonna be my year. I’m not going to put my life on hold anymore. My heart is broken, I’m sad as fuck. But I’m going to get the help I need. I’m going to start treating myself better. I’m going to make myself the best person I can be because no matter what my brain says, I’m going to love myself. I’m sorry that it took me all this time to figure it out. It’s hard with all these feelings. After I can do that, maybe if you’re still willing, I’ll be coming back to you. I’ll make you fall in love with me again, just like how we did five years ago. I want you to be happy without me but given the chance, I want you in my life again. I just hope you know that I’ll always love you. Please be happy, you deserve it. Thank you for everything, I’ll be looking towards the future from now."
332,i scared my friends with a nose bleed,"i was walking to a store to buy some stuff 
and then while walking over there i got a random nose bleed i tried to stop it 
but it got everywhere i managed to clean some but then it already dried on my face
so to prevent embarrassment i said i accidentally killed a dog to get away with a nose bleed, they believed me but they were terrified
they gave me one doller off everything i bought."
333,Butt Clenching,"When I was in elementary school, we would sit or lay in a semicircle surrounding our teacher while she told us a story. I was laying stomach down on the carpet and was very nervous and antsy. Not for any particular reason, just in general. Since I was on the floor, I could not tap my foot, so I clenched my cheeks instead. Sometimes I would alternate each cheek, or clench and unclench both to some weird rhythm in my head. The embarrassing part is that beyond the carpet were chairs for other kids to sit and listen. So half the class had a great view of my weird ass clenching tic. Of course I was teased mercilessly for this, as kids are very very evil at that age.  I don't know, that's all. I'm just known as butt clenching girl now."
334,I cleaned the garage,"Today I decided to clean up my garage after my foster kittens and their mother, even though they still live there and will make another mess in about 3 days. As I was sweeping, the kittens chased after me and kept attacking the brush and dustpan while their mother followed me around, trilling at me and wondering what I was doing.

I didn’t get as much done as I would’ve liked. I gave up when one of the kittens just grabbed the brush by the bristles and dragged it away."
335,Seems like I am the toxic person everyone decided to cut off in 2020,"I can barely get a text back or someone to answer my calls. Like, why do you do this to me???"
336,Story about watching the sunrise with my dad,"

I remember my therapist used to say when I'm feeling like this I should think about memories where I was at my happiest. It seemed like a hollow platitude at the time but now I guess I might as well try it. She said I needed to close my eyes and lay down in a dark and silent room to put myself back in that time and to make it as vivid as possible. That doesn't really work for me but what does work is writing it out, so I guess I'll do that now.

When I was maybe nine or ten on a winter trip with my family, my dad woke me up early, before daylight. Orange streetlight peeked through partially closed blinds behind me and painted shadow crisscross patterns on the walls and I stayed warm in the twilight stages of consciousness in a stiff little mattress that folded out of the couch. I hear bubbling and sizzling across the room, as the smell makes its way towards me I realize it's my father making coffee. The tap of slippers across faux hardwood vinyl and a slow creek in the darkness next to me. The crinkle of newspaper and the flash of a lamp and I turn over and pull the covers over my head. He reminds me that I have to get up if I want to go, then asks me if I still do want to go I croak out a thin response through stiff vocal chords and a dry mouth that yes I did. He says get ready then.

We're out of the hotel now, salty air and it's still dark though the sky's becoming a lighter black and I see now its laden with dense clouds. We trek down flights of blue illuminated stairs onto the street below, dark storefronts and the trolley shaking and clacking up ahead in the distance but I can't make out its shape through the fog. We walk and walk and I feel like I'm going to fall back into unconsciousness but eventually I hear waves crashing and the air stiffens and I can smell the ocean, salty, and crisp wind is making the frozen air I breathe out lash in all directions as it dissipates.

My dad says,

""Well, that wasn't too far. Now we just have to wait.""

And he sits on a little wooden bench near the cliff and as he does I go to the edge and look down, white waves through thinning fog and jagged rocks eroded over thousands of years by endless water and lines in the cliff where the sea had climbed and fallen long before I was here. I go to sit, winter coat pulled around me and hands in wool lined pockets.

We sit there for a bit, every once in a while a car rattles by and ignites the fog as it does, dense yellow mist catching fire all around me then dying out with the sound of the vehicle. We sit and sit and sit and then I'm aware of some bright huge line of glowing light somewhere miles and miles across the ocean and my dad says with that familiar optimism in his voice,

""Here it is.""

And all at once the fog begins to dissipate as the thing across the ocean rises, and beams of yellow and orange reach across the sky, over the water and over me and over the town, and hundreds of wooden pillars a mile away that stretch out of the water come into my vision one by one and I see that they're holding up a huge platform of buildings and cars and little people like insects watching this same as me, and the sea catches the srpouts of light and glows neon greenish blue and undulates as if it's some massive living thing spread out before me and as it does the sun reveals the depth of it, all the way down to the rolling mountainous bottom, and for probably the first time in my life I'm vaguely aware of how miniscule I am

My dad turns and smiles when he sees me grinning, puts his arm around me and we sit like that for a long time looking out over the water and watching the sun rise and he tells me about how he used to do this every morning with his father when they stayed here.

After a while we go back to the hotel, we stop at a cafe across the street and he gets another coffee and I get a hot chocolate. We're back before anyone else is awake and I lay in bed and read and he sits on the balcony and finishes the rest of his newspaper"
337,Another story about drugs,"Tail end of our quiet hedonistic tirade of drugs and shrugged responsibilities and emotional greed I'm walking into Jacob's house, it's dark and quiet and nice, little upper middle class block where he probably spent a childhood floating in a chemical filled pool and enjoying meals around a dinner table with a nuclear family and a bright lawn through a bay window 

He'd texted me a couple hours ago and I was passed out in my bed so now I enter, late as always


Past a grandfather clock belting out deep wooden and brass dings a long hallway, blue lights dashing out of a cracked door at the end



Walking towards it I hear staticy laughter and gunshots and electric booms and I enter wary and find Jacob, laying sprawled on a couch surrounded by sprouting plates and blankets and a little glass table covered in bags and white greasy residue and unmarked white pills that beckon to me from across the room, promising to bring that warm reassuring tangible peace and peach pills that he shouldn't be mixing in front of him just before a blaring tv, a window to another world with less problems and more excitement and when your high you can double up on the escapism


I walk over, shake him and he stirs, I barely catch pencil tip pupils through shuttering red eyelids disappearing in a halo of blue matter



He mumbles, throws his hand over his face and I fall into a chair.



Then he struggles to push himself up, situating himself to face me and says,



""Matt, do you really want to be here? I don't know if I really want to be here.""


He's slurring terribly, numb tongue and a numb brain. He won't remember this and I don't want to remember it either



""I don't want to die, you know….I just don't want to be here.""



I sit, watch some explosive animated program accompanied by a symphony of neon energy and we're both aware that the façade is falling apart quick and we're seeing something we never wanted to see, the reasons why we do what we do and I realize that after this there won't be anymore late night drives blasting stupid deep drums and electric instruments, no more watching a screen from some packed balcony, laughing obscenely and falling all over and no more mocking near death situations when we're sober, pushing away that morbid thought that soon our families might be sobbing over some tilled patch of sand in that sacred, exclusive little gated cul de sac set in the fringe of a forest, even though wed never admit it but that nice quick flash of potentially infinite emptiness in our heads clears up the knots of anxiety in our guts when we're about to pass out 

And I sit and I sit and he doesn't talk and I don't talk and he's not looking at me


""Cool if I do some lines?""



He says yeah and I chew on a little white pill that'll make me forget I ever walked through his door and bring out the coke and start cutting it up on a clean patch of the glass table and I catch some face staring at me through this little portal and wonder if im a different person in that universe"
338,"After 3 years of awkardness, I decided to talk to new people online and it was pretty good",Now I have 2 more friends to talk to
339,"2nd day of ""Making online friends"" series",The 2 friends I made already left me on read
340,I like a nice big heavy mug.,"Not just because it holds more, it just feels so much better in my hand. Even that last sip of coffee feels like it has true substance. Seriously I feel like I want a 5 pound steel bottomed mug, even if it's just for water."
341,The best way i've ever started a new year,"The fireworks were about to start, Escape by Rupert Holmes was on the radio, and it was just me and my crush in the car. We'd had a friends with benefits ish relationship for almost a year. My exact words were ""screw it"" then i kissed him and said ""i love you"". He's now my boyfriend, and this has been one of the best nights of my life 😁."
342,I finally finished a movie two years later,"A couple years ago I was watching a movie on my flight to Seattle and it got boring so I ended up watching the person's up and across from me (yay for subtitles). It was about a girl who kept reliving the same day after she died. We landed and I didn't get to see the end of the movie. I kept googling keywords like ""Tree"" ""relive the same day"" ""girl runs into wood chipper movie"" etc. No luck. All it kept pulling up was Happy Death Day about a girl who relived her birthday. That wasn't at all what I remembered but then again, I did start watching my neighbor's movie about half way through.

 Anyways, on my flight to Colorado earlier in May, I finished a movie and saw that Delta had Happy Death Day so I thought, why not. I started watching and it was the same cast and same concept but then we landed and I didn't get to finish it. 

Fast forward to today, I finally finished watching the movie but there was still no damn wood chipper scene! Turns out, there's a sequal. Happy Death Day 2U. I just finished watching it. Got my wood chipper scene and now I feel like a tiny hole in my life has been filled."
343,People keep saying I'm getting thin,"I'm fat, don't exercise and also not dieting. In fact, I've been eating like crazy. People seem to think I'm not only getting thin, but also more handsome. And my friends are not the kind to lie to make me feel better.

I'm still way above my ideal weight, and there are no immediate health concerns. So thank you God, I guess?"
344,The only New Years resolution I ever went through with...,Flossing my teeth everyday. Eight years strong in a few mins. Congrats like I’m 5! Woot!
345,I had a really nice poop this morning.,"You could say I let go of all my shit from the last decade.

But actually I’ve been focusing on eating more fruits and veggies so this was nice."
346,My little cousin is following my steps,"I'm an artist. Not a very serious one, but I draw as a hobbie. That being said, it's not uncommon to see me drawing on my sketchbook or my pc around the house whenever. That led to some situations in which my little cousin, who's almost ten y/o by now, have sat around me and just watched me drawing, while asking questions and things like that.

In the last few days, she downloaded an drawing app on her phone, and has been drawing simplified versions of things, such as foods, landscapes, objects, etc. And she always sends them to me, asking what I think about it. The other day, she came by to visit me and started asking about how to shade and such.

It's just the most wholesome thing. I never thought one day I would be in the role of the one who inspires the younger ones or something like that."
347,Cleaned out my drains,"Cleaned out the storm water drain in front of my garage today as it was full of dead leaves and I found about 5 different types of spider living in there. 

Anyway I went to smush one of the bigger ones against a box of tiles and forgot I wasn't wearing steel toe boots, really hurt my toe. But good to get that annoying job done."
348,My boyfriend is clairvoyant but only when it comes to food,"We’ve been dating for well over two years and his ability to just *sense* what food his mom or dad is going to bring home amazes me. 

A while ago he out of now where went “it’s a kfc kind of night” and an hour later with no text between them all day, his mom came home with kfc. 

Yesterday he started talking in his sleep about wanting pizza and his first coherent sentence when he woke up was “dad’s going to get [local pizza place] today” and he was fucking right. An hour later his dad asked us what we wanted from there for dinner. 

His done it with random things his mom has cooked or offered to pick up for us on her way home. He’ll just randomly say “mom is going to pick up McDonald’s on her way home” or “mom picked up donuts on her way home” and he’s always fucking right! He doesn’t even have contact with her until she asks him want he wants and he doesn’t know she’s gotten donuts on her way home from the night shift until he goes downstairs in the morning."
349,My cat is attacking an inflated balloon and I haven't cringed this much in a very long time,When will it pop? I am nervous. The underlying balloon sound is relaxing despite the anxiety and it's been ten minutes but I still keep cringing.
